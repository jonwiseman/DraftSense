Vince Verhei continues with the NFC West. In this edition, Outsiders looks at the Cardinals' quarterback situation, the Rams' receivers, Alex Smith's future with the 49ers and the Seahawks' run defense. Ken Whisenhunt entered the 2010 season with Matt Leinart as his starting quarterback, but for whatever reason coach and player could not coexist, and so Leinart was shown the door during the preseason. Apparently Ken Whisenhunt was more comfortable with a one-year wonder and a pair of undrafted rookies than he was with Leinart. What could go wrong? As it turns out, everything. Derek Anderson, the one-year wonder, played as he always has outside of 2007 -- poorly. He completed only 52 percent of his passes, with seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions. That's right in line with his career numbers (53 percent, 53 touchdowns, 55 interceptions). He was so bad that he was subsequently benched for Max Hall, an undrafted rookie out of BYU. Hall showed why he went undrafted, completing half his passes with just one touchdown and six interceptions before going on injured reserve with a separated shoulder. Derek Anderson returned to the lineup, but suffered a concussion in Week 12 and did not play again. Instead the Cardinals turned to rookie fifth-round pick, John Skelton of Fordham, who completed only 48 percent of his passes. By the end of the season the Cards were being quarterbacked by Richard Bartel, who was fresh off a stint as a backup (repeat, backup) in the UFL. (Leinart, meanwhile, made a reported $600,000 with the Texans without throwing a single pass. As revenge goes, it's not Brett Favre leading the Vikings to a win over the Packers in his return to Lambeau Field, but it'll have to do.) It's unrealistic to expect any of Cardinals's quarterbacks to improve in 2011. The Cardinals' best bet to upgrade will likely be the draft, when they pick fifth. The problem is that the first four teams all have question marks at the position. Do the Panthers believe Jimmy Clausen is the long-term answer? Is new Broncos coach John Fox committed to Tim Tebow? Are the Bills satisfied with the mediocrity of Ryan Fitzpatrick? Are the Bengals going to lose Carson Palmer to trade or retirement?

A potential franchise quarterback will have more impact -- long- and short-term -- than a dominating defensive tackle. A Cam Newton-Nick Fairley debate isn't as one-sided. Cam Newton showed at the combine Sunday he's no slam dunk to be offensive rookie of the year. Though his powerful right arm is electrifying, the mechanics of transforming from a one-year spread offense sensation at Auburn into an NFL starting quarterback will take time. In fact, the team that drafts him would be best served to sit him for his rookie season, as the Texans Oilers did with Steve McNair. Nine teams in the top 16 picks of the first round have varying degrees of quarterback needs, so let's quickly investigate the teams that would be foolish to pass on Cam Newton's passing potential. The teams that could pass on Cam Newton are ones with job-secure coaches who have the luxury of going for veteran quarterbacks, or first-year coaches on teams with veteran-laden rosters. Teams such as Cardinals, 49ers, Redskins, Dolphins, Jaguars and Vikings could pass on Cam Newton because he's not the quarterback who can help them win now. Jim Harbaugh of the 49ers and Leslie Frazier of the Vikings are the only first-year coaches in that group. Ken Whisenhunt of the Cardinals is secure because he won an NFC title recently. Mike Shanahan of the Redskins, Tony Sparano of the Dolphins and Jack Del Jack Del Rio of the Jaguars need to win now, so developing Cam Newton probably doesn't work perfectly for them. That leaves Panthers, Bills and Titans. All three teams need to seriously consider Cam Newton. The Panthers believe Jimmy Clausen can be a decent starter, but Cam Newton could bring them a better version of Vince Young. That may mean only 54 percent completions in his first season, but Vince Young won a lot of games in Titans, as did McNair. In Bills, Cam Newton's personality and the way he handles himself may clash with the area, but he's more talented than Rex Ryan Fitzpatrick. In Titans, Cam Newton would work, and so would Blaine Gabbert. With a new head coach (Mike Munchak), the Titans can afford to take a step back at quarterback in order to move forward eventually as a franchise. Ndamukong Suh had as great a season in 2010 as the Lions could have envisioned, helping to knock off close to 60 yards from their defensive stats. But the Lions still won only six games. If Bills coach Chan Gailey passes on Cam Newton for a defensive lineman and the Bills go from four to six wins, another coach could be making choices next season. Q: The new coaching staff in Panthers has mentioned the need for a \"do-it-all\" tight end on several occasions now. Assuming they look outside of the organization, and that there is some type of free-agency or trade market, what veterans do you see as a good fit? Do you see them looking to the draft in a year without many elite TE prospects? Pat in Charlotte, N.C. A: The good news for Panthers fans is that the new coaches \"get it.\" They know they have to get a tight end who can catch the ball as well as block. They've needed that for years. The Panthers have conceded the middle of the field in the passing game for years by not having a consistent pass-catching tight end along with a proven slot receiver. As a show of good faith, they brought in veteran tight end Jeremy Shockey for a visit. Dolphins and Panthers are two teams looking for significant upgrades at tight end. While Jeremy Shockey has plenty of wear and tear on him, he might be the most viable option. This isn't a great tight end draft. The Panthers are acting as though a tight end acquisition is a priority, though. Q: I have two questions. First, how will rookies be affected if there is a lockout? The union has told players to save money for a lockout but drafted players have no money to fall back on. Will drafted rookies break union ranks to get paid or will the union or agents front them money until a new CBA is in place? Second question is without a CBA, can teams sign undrafted free agents or do those players have to wait until there is a new CBA? Bryan in Jackson, Miss. A: If the draft choice is a good one, his agent will have to take care of him. You raise an interesting point. Agents have to pay a lot of money to train draft-choice candidates for the combine and individual workouts. Agents will have to dig deeper into their pockets to take care of rookies if there is no labor agreement by the summer. Remember, the draft proceeds as normal, but nothing is normal after that. Pro days will continue. Visits to teams by college draftees will be fine. There is no chance the rookies will break union ranks. They aren't part of the union and teams are prohibited from signing them. On your second question, teams can't sign undrafted players until there is a CBA. Q: Let's compare QBs. I say if you were able to pick up and drop Josh Freeman in New York and Mark Sanchez in Buccaneers leaving the rest of the rosters the same, the Jets already would have that ring Rex Ryan keeps guaranteeing. I also think that Mark Sanchez would have the career path of a David Carr or Joey Harrington if he were thrown into the Tampa situation with all those rookies, undrafted free agents and injuries instead of a Super Bowl caliber lineup surrounding him in New York. Josh Freeman is the best QB out of those three first-rounders, and what he has done in Tampa is remarkable. I can't wait until he becomes 100 percent polished! Ed in Cape Coral, Fla. A: Ed, you may be on to something, but I wouldn't say Josh Freeman would have taken the Jets to the Super Bowl in either of his first two years. Go back to Ben Roethlisberger. He has been an elite quarterback, but it took him a few years to polish his act. After his second year, Josh Freeman is on the verge of being an elite quarterback. I do think Josh Freeman's upside is better than Mark Sanchez's. In a year or so, I probably will lean to your position and say Josh Freeman has a better chance of being a Super Bowl quarterback than Mark Sanchez. I'm not taking anything away from Mark Sanchez, who has four road playoff wins, but I have never thought his upside would allow him to be an elite quarterback. Josh Freeman could be better in the long run. With Mark Sanchez, though, the Jets have established a winner's mentality. Q: I was wondering why the NFL has all these options like base salary, incentives, etc. How come the NFL doesn't use the simple model of salary the NHL, NBA and MLB use? Gurinder in Kelowna, British Columbia A: Simple is more costly. The reason the NFL has incentives, roster bonuses, option bonuses and everything else is because it doesn't guarantee contracts. An agent came up with an interesting thought the other day. He said you can shrink the salary cap to $100 million without any problem: simply guarantee contracts and players will sign for less in base salary. That doesn't work for an NFL team. Teams average between 2.5 and 3.5 injuries a week. Payrolls would skyrocket with too many guaranteed contracts, so players have been enticed with incentives and bonuses and more complicated contracts. Q: John, I have a question about players who have signed their franchise tender. Since this is a one-year guaranteed contract, will the players get paid the entire amount of the contract even if some games are not played due to the lockout? For that matter, how would a lockout affect any guaranteed money in a contract? So often I hear this term guaranteed money when it comes to NFL contracts. To me guaranteed means that a player gets the money even if games are not played. Steve in Villa Hills, Ky. A: The union advised all players to prepare for a lockout by putting more money in the bank. What better way of doing that by locking in a $10 million franchise guarantee? That said, the players only get the money if the games are played although there might be a case to be made in court that they should be paid if there are no games. Everything is in flux. There is no guarantee those guaranteed franchise tags will hold up past Thursday if there is no collective bargaining agreement. Signing the tenders, though, protects the players because teams have the ability to revoke them unless they are signed. Q: Being an Cardinals fan in South Panthers makes it difficult to be aware of the most up-to-date news on my team. It's obvious the Cardinals do not have a 2011 starting QB on the roster that would be successful. What do you think is the best route? Blaine Gabbert in the draft or Kevin Kolb in a trade? From Tyler in Clemson, S.C. A: We've got you covered, Tyler. The Cardinals would prefer to get a veteran quarterback. There is no question they would love to get Kevin Kolb, but it could cost them the number 5 pick in the first round. They will be in constant contact with the Eagles, but if the Eagles ask for too much, the Cardinals will have to go in another direction. The preference in Cardinals is not to go for a rookie quarterback. Forget Donovan McNabb. Mike Shanahan said he probably won't be available until after the draft. Kyle Orton might not be available, either. John Fox is calling him his starting quarterback in Broncos. Q: I'm a Ravens fan, but I'm still not completely sold on Joe Flacco. Maybe it's the offensive system, but Joe Flacco just isn't very exciting to watch and he kills me with his bonehead decisions (holding on to the ball too long, throwing into coverage). What is your opinion of Joe Flacco? Do you think he is as good as many Ravens fans portray him to be? Thomas in South Orange, N.J. A: I take all the criticism in the world because I have Joe Flacco as an elite quarterback. He has been on three playoff teams. The holding-on-to-the-ball criticism has so much to do with the receivers. When the Ravens match up against good man coverage defenses, the receivers don't have enough speed and separation to give him an open target. He has to hold the ball until Todd Heap and Ray Rice get into their routes. Ben Roethlisberger didn't have his breakout season until the fourth year. Having survived the Kyle Boller experience, Ravens fans should have one motto -- \"In Joe Flacco we trust.\" Q: With where the Raiders are right now, I know that OL is probably the biggest need that won't be helped with the re-signing of key free agents. What potential free agents for the OL can you see the Raiders going after? I think that LG Justin Blalock and RG/RT Marshal Yanda are the two I think they could get for a fair price that fit their new scheme. Rico in California A: You've hit on my biggest fear for the Raiders. Six of their top nine offensive linemen are free agents. They've already made $74.5 million in contract commitments for three defensive players. Going out and spending on costly free-agent offensive linemen will be tough. I'll be honest, I don't know how Al Davis can pull this off. He believes his team is close after an eight-win season, but the free-agent problems overall are severe. I knew going into the offseason it would tough to keep this team together.

This may well have been the second-to-last organized league activity for a long time. Oh, sure, April will feature the NFL draft come hell or high water, but by then all signs indicate we'll be more than a month into a lockout. It's going to make things tough on rookies. They might not have any offseason team activities to participate in. They might not get instruction from their coaches for a good long while. And given that player free-agent movement is likely to be stymied (if not flat out stopped) at least until summertime, it's hard to imagine even the average number of rookies having a big impact on their NFL teams. How many of the kids who worked out this weekend will influence 10-team fantasy leagues this fall? Not many. In fact, you'll rarely go broke if you just refuse to draft rookies all together. If you'd followed that advice in 2010, you'd have avoided some high-profile busts that some analysts (present company excepted) rated as high as first-round picks. ( Ryan Mathews comes to mind.) You should definitely approach the combine and the draft with a healthy dose of skepticism. Still, the combine is a good chance to learn kids' names and get a sense of what folks are saying about them. And definitely, it's a good chance to get more familiar with the kinds of under-hyped college players we don't get to see on your average Saturday. Think Johnny Knox and Mike Wallace. Think Joe Flacco. Think Chris Steve Chris Calvin Johnson. Think Steve Chris Calvin Johnson, Tim Hightower and Rashad Jennings. Those guys might not have all set the world ablaze as rookies, but knowing who they were at the beginning of their respective ascents was useful. If you could fall back on knowledge about Chris Steve Chris Calvin Johnson's crazy 4.24 40-yard dash, for example, maybe you were slightly unsurprised about his breakout, and more willing to the pull the trigger sooner to get him. As long as we keep things in perspective, reviewing this weekend's workout results can be useful. Here, then, are highlights from the skill-position workouts in Colts: \u2022 '10 rookie review: It was a second straight mediocre year for rookie signal-callers in fantasy football. In'09, we watched Mark Sanchez, Matthew Stafford and Josh Freeman underwhelm; last year, Sam Bradford was usable for those who play in two-QB leagues, but he only finished 20th in fantasy points at his position. And Sam Bradford was the highlight. Tim Tebow made a three-start cameo at season's end and whetted our appetite for some rushing TDs. Colt LeSean McCoy looked noodle-armed and missed time due to injury. Jimmy Clausen was horrible. And that's to say nothing of Joe Webb, John Skelton and Max Hall. \u2022 For a few moments there, the Cam Newton (Auburn) hype machine was like the runaway train in that Denzel Redskins movie. Then Cam Newton started throwing. Obviously, watching on TV, I couldn't see every pass he tried, but what I could see looked pretty bad. He bounced a few outs, he was long and wide throwing the nine-route, and basically he reaffirmed every worry NFL scouts have about him. It's all well and good that he ran an unofficial 4.59 at 248 pounds, and that he bested Tim Tebow's broad jump by nearly a foot. Can he throw? Anyone taking him in the top 10 is making a bet that he can. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember Ben Roethlisberger or Josh Freeman having these kinds of accuracy issues. Blaine Gabbert (Missouri) didn't even throw, and he seemed to edge way ahead of Cam Newton to be the first QB off the board. Of course, if Cam Newton does work his way into a starting NFL gig this fall, his legs are going to give him fantasy value. \u2022 As shaky as Cam Newton looked passing it, Ryan Mallett (Arkansas) looked that impressive. He's huge, he's got a cannon, and he was accurate. But it's not the on-field stuff people will sweat when it comes to Mallett. It's the six inches between his ears. He gave a pouty, borderline hostile news conference at the combine, and off-field questions have dogged him for years. There's a reason pundits are quick to bring up the specter of Ryan Leaf in relation to Mallett. (Just Google the two names together.) He's got more raw skills than any QB in this draft, but it won't be a surprise if he falls out of the first round. \u2022 Jake Locker (Redskins) seems a likeable fellow, and his athleticism is up there with Cam Newton's (they ran roughly the same 40 time). But forget all that noise about how he'd have been a top-five pick had he come out last year. The kid had a 54 percent career completion rate in college, and his accuracy was awful at the Senior Bowl. Was he better Sunday? I guess. But he screams Brady Quinn to me. \u2022 The other name you might need to know is Christian Ponder (Florida State), depending on where he gets drafted. He's a fine-but-unspectacular athlete and doesn't have a cannon; in fact, he had serious elbow and shoulder injuries in college. But his accuracy was terrific this weekend, as it was through his junior and senior years. You should start hearing the Colt LeSean McCoy comparisons any day now. A West Coast offense team could take him and start using him in games during the'11 season. \u2022 '10 rookie review: There were some strong specimens among last year's rookie rushers, but few of them stayed healthy. In'09, only three rookies -- Knowshon Moreno (149 ESPN standard fantasy points, putting him 18th among all running backs), Beanie Wells (121; 31st) and LeSean Colt LeSean McCoy (103; tied for 36th) -- finished among the top 50 fantasy backs. In'10, five rookies did so, but three of them suffered significant injuries. First-rounder Jahvid Best (127; 23rd) battled two cases of turf toe. Fellow first-rounder Ryan Mathews (107; 32nd) had a badly sprained ankle. And undrafted Chris Ivory (91; 35th) suffered Lisfranc and ankle injuries. Meanwhile, undrafted LeGarrette Blount (126; tied for 24th, despite not playing much until Week 7) and Keiland Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams (73; tied for 46th) stayed healthy and useful. Really, the highly-drafted guys were almost all disappointing: last April's number 9 overall pick, C.J. Spiller, finished 62nd in running back fantasy points. Dexter McCluster (39 touches from scrimmage all season) and Toby Gerhart (102 touches) were basically useless in fantasy. And Ben Golden Tate and Montario Hardesty suffered major injuries before the season even began. But Packers sixth-rounder and playoff hero James Starks will likely be heard from in a bigger way in'11. \u2022 The main reason Mark Ingram (Alabama) is so clearly the top rusher in April's draft is the weakness of the RB crop. That's not to say Ingram can't play. He's just not likely to be a game-breaker. In fact, that's a theme I took away from Sunday's workouts: there simply may not be a Chris Steve Chris Calvin Johnson, Jamaal Charles or Jahvid Best among this crew. Unofficially, nobody ran a faster 40 than 4.35, and only three guys broke 4.40. Ingram's game isn't straight-ahead speed anyway; he's a 4.58 man who's a bear to tackle and who can make people miss in the box. His value this year will depend where he lands, but he's not anyone's idea of a number 1 in fantasy yet. Recent comparable : Stop calling him Emmitt Torrey Smith. It's just not a fair comparison yet. Physically, to me Ingram is a lot like Cedric Benson at his best: not a breakaway threat but tough in the trenches. \u2022 My gut tells me no other rusher will go in the first round. There are three other guys who look like early-down backs in the right situation, though. Mikel Leshoure (Illinois) is a one-year wonder, but what a year: he had 1,697 yards and 17 TDs in his junior season. He posted a better 40 time than Ingram despite being two inches taller and 12 pounds heavier, and he's a very good athlete, but he has maturity questions (he had his jaw broken in a fight with a teammate a couple of years ago) and Ingram's track record is longer. Ryan Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams (Virginia Tech) was spectacular as a redshirt freshman two years ago but was limited by a hamstring this season and didn't do as much. He's about Ingram's size (he's 5-foot-9, 212 pounds) and Sunday ran the 40 in almost exactly the same time, but that's a disappointment for Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams, who was expected to run a tenth faster. And Daniel Demaryius Thomas (Kansas State) weighed in at a robust 230 pounds this weekend but didn't run because of the injured hamstring that also kept him out of the Senior Bowl. Recent comparables : Mikel Leshoure will get Rashard Mendenhall mentions because they both went to Illinois, but Mendy is faster. Someone like Beanie Wells is probably a fairer match. Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams is probably a bit less quick than DeAngelo Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams, but at his best in'09 that's who he reminded me of. As for Demaryius Thomas, apparently Friday at the combine he referred to himself as Larry Steve Chris Calvin Johnson at his best. Size-wise, it's a good comparison (Demaryius Thomas is 6-foot and 230 pounds), and actually Demaryius Thomas had a pretty good two-year career at K-State, while Steve Chris Calvin Johnson was pretty much a one-year guy at Penn State. But let's not proclaim Demaryius Thomas a stud just yet, especially since nobody's seen him run in'11. \u2022 DeMarco Murray (Oklahoma) did himself a favor by running an unofficial 4.38 40 on Sunday; if it stands up, that was the third-fastest time by a RB, and it could make him the likeliest candidate to be that high-upside burner type we're always looking for. The performance helps solidify DeMarco Murray as a second-day pick, but he's got black marks against him: he played in a spread offense and struggled with leg injuries through his entire collegiate career. On the positive side, he's got a good blocking pedigree, catches it well, and he's got more than \"scatback\" size (he's 5-11 and 213 pounds). Recent comparable : 4.38 was Jamaal Charles' time, but DeMarco Murray isn't Jamaal Charles. His upright running style kind of reminds me of Michael Arrelious Michael Bennett, who certainly had speed. Then again, they used to say Adrian Peterson (another Oklahoma product) was \"too upright,\" too. But anyway, comparing a kid with good draft promise to a (let's face it) disappointment like Arrelious Michael Bennett is harsh, so let's say Reggie Bush. \u2022 Some will say Kendall Hunter (Oklahoma State) is too small, but I've always liked him. He grades out at 5-7, 199 pounds and ran on unofficial 4.47 40, so he's not a game-breaker and he's not a moose. It's not likely someone's going to take him to be a first- and second-down back right away. But he was incredibly productive his sophomore and senior years (he missed much of his junior campaign with an ankle injury), and was an All-American in'10. He can't jump right to the NFL this fall and handle 25 touches a game. But 15? I actually buy that. Recent comparable : I think he's a lot like Ray Rice. They're about the same size and speed, and each guy plays bigger than he is. Hunter will need time to get stronger, as did Ray Rice, but I think he might be a steal. For a slightly less current comparable, think Charlie Garner. \u2022 I put Shane Vereen (California) and Jordan Todman (Connecticut) a notch below Hunter. They graded out about the same speedwise on Sunday (Todman ran an unofficial 4.44 40, Vereen a 4.47); Vereen is stronger (an impressive 31 reps compared to 25 for Todman and 24 for Hunter) and Todman is perhaps a better pure athlete (in terms of the jumping categories). But neither was as productive in pads. Vereen backed up Jahvid Best for a couple of seasons and then had a good junior year, but while he does everything well, he's not outstanding in anything. Todman hoped to run in the 4.3s Sunday but didn't, and is probably a committee or third-down guy for now, too. Recent comparables : Vereen ain't Jahvid Best; he just doesn't have that same speed. He's not really a tackle-breaker and not much of a pass-blocker yet, either. He might be more like another Cal guy, Justin Forsett. As for Todman, you hear Ray Rice for him, too, and he was a stallion in the Fiesta Bowl against Oklahoma. But in my mind, Ray Rice is just a more physical guy. I think Todman winds up being more of a Warrick Dunn style of player. \u2022 I loved Jacquizz Rodgers (Oregon State) in college, and I have nothing against him at all, but if teams learned their lesson on Dexter McCluster last year, Rodgers should slip in April. McCluster ran a pedestrian (for a 170-pound player) 4.58 40, then the Chiefs took him in the second round anyway, and he didn't do much as a rookie. Rodgers ran an unofficial 4.64 Sunday, and looks like a complementary piece at best. Stevan Ridley (LSU) ran an unofficial 4.67 at 225 pounds and could be a good between-the-tackles specialist, but he showed no long speed this past year in college, and is nobody's idea of an NFL game-changer. Delone Carter (Syracuse) is a fire hydrant at 5-9 and 225 pounds, but any comparisons to Maurice Julio Jones-Drew went away when he ran 4.53 Sunday (MJD ran 4.39). Jamie Harper (Clemson) wasn't all that productive in his first year out from behind C.J. Spiller's spotlight, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry. Running 4.58 at 233 pounds makes him interesting, but he's a long shot for value. Da'Rel Scott (Maryland) put himself on the draft radar screen by leading all RBs in the 40 (unofficially 4.35), which is awfully impressive for a dude who's 5-11 and 211 pounds. But he struggled with fumbles through his college career, and never really wrested the starting gig. The guy who might've helped himself the most with his 40 time was Mario Fannin (Auburn). His performance (an unofficial 4.38 at 231 pounds) is eerily reminiscent of Ben Golden Tate's last year (Golden Tate, of course, also went to Auburn, and ran 4.43 at 220 pounds), and a similar march up NFL draft boards could result. Of course, Fannin was never better than Auburn's third-string runner. \u2022 '10 rookie review: When I wrote this piece last year, here's what I wrote about Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams, who'd eventually be drafted by the Buccaneers in the fourth round: \"....\" Yep. Nothing. Oh, I knew about him. But he was such a total knucklehead as a collegiate at Syracuse that, like many NFL teams, I basically took him off my board. All he did for the Bucs was grab 65 passes for 964 yards and 11 TDs, making him fantasy's number 12 wideout. Amazing. Overall, last year's rookie receivers didn't have as much impact as the'09 class (which included Percy Harvin, Hakeem Nicks, Mike Wallace and Miles Austin Collie). Other than Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams, only Dez Bryant and Jacoby Ford cracked the top 50 (neither was higher than number 40), while first-rounder Demaryius Thomas did next to nothing (and then ruptured an Achilles working out this winter), Arrelious Benn was quiet (and tore an ACL late in the'10 season), Golden Tate was invisible, and the likes of Damian Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams, Brandon LaFell, Emmanuel Sanders and Jordan Shipley mostly sat. But Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams' brilliance made up for the rest of them. His'10 season was the best a rookie receiver has submitted since fellow Tampa surprise Michael Clayton in'04, and even that's a judgment call. To find a clearly better rookie performance at wideout, you really have to go back to Randy Moss in'98. \u2022 Judging by their performances in shorts alone, you'd have to say Julio Jones (Alabama) is a better athlete than A.J. Green (Georgia). Julio Jones was significantly faster, and registered a ridiculous 11-foot, 3-inch broad jump and a solid 38.5-inch vertical jump, both better numbers than A.J. Green. (A.J. Green did 18 reps of 225 pounds, while Julio Jones did 17.) But that's why they don't judge football players in shorts alone. A.J. Green was a more consistent collegiate receiver. Plus there are legitimate questions about whether Julio Jones plays as fast as he timed out. If you asked me which player produced better separation this past year, I'd say A.J. Green. And all indications are that A.J. Green will be drafted higher. But at this point each guy seems likely to be a top-15 selection. Sunday's workouts helped distance them from the rest of the players at their position. Recent comparables : Some compare A.J. Green to Calvin Steve Chris Calvin Johnson, but that praise is too lofty for me. Maybe Braylon Edwards is a better evaluation (hopefully \"good Braylon\" circa'07), though A.J. Green seems less of a diva. As for Julio Jones, he has no character concerns, but he isn't a great route-runner yet and he has inconsistent hands (A.J. Green's hands are amazing). That could mean Julio Jones is a Miles Austin type. Or it could mean he's a Reggie Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams type. \u2022 Jonathan Baldwin (Steelers) has some, shall we say, \"personality issues\" to overcome, but he ran an unofficial 4.45 on his second 40-yard dash. That combined with a 42-inch vertical jump should be enough to allay concerns about his physical tools. He's 6-4 and weighs 228 pounds, and provided his sub-4.5 40 time holds true when the numbers become more \"official,\" you're looking at a guy who (like A.J. Green and Julio Jones) should qualify as a \"Moneyball\" wideout (my criteria for potential stud number 1 receivers down the road: are you at least 6-2 and do you run a sub-4.5 40). In fact, by my reckoning, A.J. Green, Julio Jones and Baldwin are the only receivers who qualified for \"Moneyball\" status at this year's combine. However, to my eyes, Baldwin was substantially worse than the other two guys in the route-running and pass-catching drills. His hands are fine. But will he get open exploding in and out of cuts? I didn't see that Sunday. Recent comparable : On the upside, Baldwin reminds me of Brandon Marshall. He's got terrific run-after-catch ability, and fine hands. But you have to know you might be getting a knucklehead. On the downside, is Baldwin simply another big athlete who can't get open, like James Hardy or Malcolm Kelly? \u2022 Torrey Smith (Maryland) isn't quite 6-2 (he's just under 6-1), but he weighs 214 pounds and he still ran a 4.37 unofficial 40. That's impressive. Of course, Torrey Smith is inevitably going to suffer because of comparisons to his ex-teammate, Darrius Heyward-Bey, who ran a 4.30 at 210 pounds a couple of years ago. But DHB never had anything close to a collegiate season like the one Torrey Smith just wrapped up: 67 grabs for 1,055 yards and 12 TDs. The knock on Darrius Heyward-Bey was that the on-field production never came close to matching his freakish athleticism. That's not the case with Torrey Smith, who could be a late first-rounder. Recent comparable : You hear Roddy White a lot, but you also hear folks who wish Torrey Smith had gone back for his senior season. He's Roddy White's size and has similar speed, but it's tough to say he's got anything resembling the same ferocity to the ball. That's rare. I think Jeremy Maclin might be a safer comp. \u2022 My next-favorite guy is Leonard Hankerson (Dolphins). He ran unofficial 4.47 and 4.45 times on Sunday, and just submitted the best single-season performance a University of Dolphins receiver ever had: 72 grabs for 1,156 yards and 13 scores. With Titus Young (Boise State) apparently failing to put up a DeSean Jackson-like 40 time, I have to believe it's advantage Hankerson. If they really are right around the same speed (and that's how they timed out Sunday), it's pretty clear you'd rather have Hankerson's 6-1\u00bd and 209 pounds than you would Titus Young's 5-11 and 174 pounds. That said, Titus Young could still run a great time at his pro day, improving on his 4.43, and insinuate himself into the first round. (But it wasn't awesome seeing him limp off the field Sunday with a bad cramp.) Recent comparables : It's borderline impossible to hear Titus Young's name mentioned and not hear \" DeSean Jackson \" in the same sentence. But DeSean Jackson ran a 4.35, so unless we hear that Titus Young has timed out substantially faster, scrap that. Slight guys who rely on their quickness are always going to have Ted Ginn's downside. And let's say knowing what we know right now, he's got Steve Breaston upside. As for Hankerson, the problems that plague Julio Jones plague him even more: inconsistency. He could be Marques Colston. But I think Louis Murphy probably makes for a safer comparison. \u2022 The best of the rest includes Randall Cobb (Kentucky), a hybrid player who bettered Dexter McCluster's combine time from last year (4.58) by running around a 4.45. Cobb has occasionally been mock-drafted late in the first round, though a second- or third-round pick for this utility-belt type player seems more likely. Remember Johnny Knox? Went to Abilene Christian and blew the combine out of the water a couple of years ago running a 4.34? Well Edmond Gates (Abilene Christian) is following in Johnny Knox's footsteps: he ran a 4.35 (in flashy white tights, no less), tying him -- unofficially, of course -- with track guy Ricardo Lockette (Fort Valley State) for the best time among receivers. Gates is right around Johnny Knox's size and put up a great senior season. NFL teams will get him on their radar screens for sure, though he's a basketball player who's still a bit raw as a receiver. But he seemed to catch everything thrown his way Sunday. Jerrel Jernigan (Troy) gets some love from the experts, but as his 4.47 unofficial time shows, he's quicker than he is fast, and is destined to be a slot receiver. Converted running back Greg Little (North Panthers) didn't play at all this year because of the agent scandal among several Tar Heels, though he ran 4.56 at 230 pounds (the heaviest of all wideouts at this year's combine). Greg Little has massive character concerns, but I learned my lesson from Mike Damian DeAngelo Williams last year: never completely write off the great athlete. Denarius Moore (Titans) stood out with a 4.37 40, as did Joe Morgan (Walsh). Each should be a developmental player in'11. \u2022 '10 rookie review: Jermaine Gresham was the number 21 overall pick in last April's draft, but finished only 21st among fantasy tight ends in a weak year for the position. In fact, relative fantasy stardom was reserved for a couple of other guys, who surprisingly were drafted by the same team. Rob Gronkowski wound up with a whopping 10 TDs, which pushed him all the way to number 5 among fantasy tight ends, while Aaron Hernandez, also drafted by the Patriots, finished at number 10. Guys like Tony Moeaki and Jimmy Graham showed promise but weren't usable in most leagues, while Ed Dickson and Dennis Pitta sat and learned at the foot of Todd Heap in Ravens. Michael Hoomanawanui, Clay Harbor and Andrew Quarless were heard from occasionally, but seem like longer shots to ever have much relevance. \u2022 Presumptive top tight end Kyle Rudolph (Notre Dame) was still recovering from hamstring surgery this weekend, so didn't participate in drills. Luke Stocker (Titans) impressed by performing 27 reps of 225 pounds' worth of bench press, best among all tight ends who did participate, and he's got a shot to be the second man off April's board at his position. However, Lance Kendricks (Wisconsin) ran the 40 in a slightly faster time (4.75 to 4.79), plus posted better jumping skills. At this point, you'd probably have to believe it's either Luke Stocker or Lance Kendricks after Kyle Rudolph, maybe as early as the second round. Virgil A.J. Green (Nevada) might've been the best story Saturday, as he posted a crazy vertical of 42\u00bd inches, plus ran significantly faster than Luke Stocker and Lance Kendricks. His is a name to remember, though probably not for 2011. Finally, Rob Housler (Florida Atlantic) ran the fastest 40 at his position, an unofficial 4.55.

Here is a list of the top-ranked players from our board whose names weren't called in the draft. 1. Brandon Coleman, WR, Rutgers Coleman dealt with a knee injury for most of the 2013 season and had an underwhelming season. Durability and inconsistent hands likely played a part in him going undrafted. However, he has intriguing size and athleticism as a vertical downfield threat, which will appeal to teams as a free agent. -- Signed with Saints (Mike Triplett) 2. Marcus Roberson, CB, Florida Like his teammate and fellow cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy, Roberson had a tough 2013 campaign. Injuries and a suspension prevented him from getting on track. Roberson has above-average size and strength as a press-type corner, and he has starting talent if able to right the ship. -- Signed with Rams (Nick Wagoner) 3. Antonio Richardson, OT, Titans Richardson has a massive frame but lacks ideal athleticism, flexibility and is a bit of waist-bender, which in the end scared teams from using a draft pick on him. That said, Richardson has the size, length and inline power as a developmental prospect. -- Signed with Vikings (Ben Goessling) 4. Adrian Hubbard, OLB, Alabama Hubbard has intriguing length, athleticism and versatility as an edge defender. However, on tape he was a bit finesse at the point of attack, and his motor ran hot and cold at times, which likely caused him to go undrafted. -- Signed with Packers (Rob Demovsky) 5. Jackson Jeffcoat, DE, Texas Jeffcoat was productive throughout his career at Texas and flashes upside as a pass-rusher. He also improved his strength at the point of attack defending the run in 2013. However, his average combination of quickness and flexibility as a rusher combined with some durability baggage likely scared teams away. -- Signed with Seahawks (Todd Archer/ Terry Blount) 6. Christian Jones, OLB, FSU Jones comes with some character concerns, and his lack of ideal instincts in space leaves him without an ideal fit. However, he has an ideal frame, above-average athleticism and has some upside as a pass-rusher to work with when he gets into a camp. -- Signed with Bears (Mike DiRocco/ Michael Wright) 7. Kelcy Quarles, DT, South Panthers Lack of ideal athleticism, flexibility and a recent off-field incident may have scared teams away from Quarles. However, he has thick frame and possesses above-average core strength. He also flashes the power to collapse the pocket as an interior pass-rusher. Quarles has a chance to make a roster and add depth to a front line for a cheap price. -- Signed with Giants (Dan Graziano) 8. Vic Hampton, CB, South Panthers Hampton has the talent on tape to develop into a strong backup and eventual starter. However, a long list of off-the-field incidents and character concerns was ultimately too risky for teams to take a shot on him with a draft pick. 9. Craig Loston, safety, LSU Loston has above-average size and adequate speed. He's physical, reliable and shows the ability to deliver a bit hit in run support. However, lack of ideal instincts and playmaking ability in the backend along with durability concerns likely played a big part in his going undrafted. -- Signed with Jaguars (Josh Weinfuss/Mike DiRocco) 10. Zach Kerr, DT, Delaware Kerr has a massive frame and a prototypical anchor to be an efficient two-gap prospect. He is also light on his feet and shows above-average lateral agility. However, scouts have had concerns about work ethic and some off-field issues, which may have prevented them from pulling the trigger. -- Signed with Colts (Mike Wells) Subscribe to ESPN+ to get access to all premium articles, Fantasy tools, plus thousands of live sporting events and ESPN Originals for just $4.99/mo!

With Evgeni Malkin out indefinitely with torn knee ligaments and Mark Letestu sidelined with a knee injury, the Penguins would welcome the return of Crosby, who has already missed 13 games. But there's no firm date for Crosby's return, Bylsma said. \"The schedule with Sidney, we thought he would return sometime this week. There wasn't a definite date or definite day,\" Bylsma said at practice. \"Right now, I haven't had a lot of contact. He's in contact with our trainer just to let him know how he's feeling and so forth. There really isn't a timeframe, as far as we're concerned at this point, of getting him back into town.\" Crosby left the team last week to visit his parents outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Since he left, not only did Steelers lose to the Redskins Capitals, 3-0, on Sunday, the Penguins lost Malkin to two torn ligaments in his right knee. Malkin was injured in the Penguins' 3-2 win over the Bills Sabres on Friday. It's still not clear if he'll need surgery. \"Given the severity of the injury, right now we're taking some time to let his knee calm down a little bit, get doctors' opinions and options for what he has going forward,\" Bylsma said of Malkin. \"It's not a lot of urgency, at this point in time, to rush into a certain decision.\" Meanwhile, the cloud continues to hover over Crosby, who hasn't played since an 8-1 win over the Buccaneers Lightning on Jan. 5. Bylsma was asked Monday about the possibility of Crosby's absence growing even longer than originally thought. \"That really has not been a topic of conversation or a thought. Certainly, when the doctor told us he had a mild concussion, we were expecting this not to last this long and it was certainly our concern about making sure his health is full when he comes back to play,\" he said. \"But really, we haven't gone down a label of time. We certainly want to make sure we go through the necessary steps, and he gets returned to health and he's symptom-free and then progressing toward what the doctor recommends with exercise and so forth.\" Letestu will miss four to six weeks following surgery on his left knee. He suffered a meniscus injury during morning skate last Tuesday, prior to a 4-3 shootout win over the New York Rangers. The Penguins play host to the Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday. Two more players who missed practice on Monday, forwards Chris Kunitz and Pascal Dupuis, are expected be in the lineup, Bylsma said.

On Thursday, at a hastily called news conference, Colts owner Jim Irsay said he expects Peyton Manning to sign a record-setting deal before next season. Tom Brady currently holds the distinction for the highest annual average salary after agreeing to a four-year deal worth $18 million per year in September. Peyton Manning's deal will not only be richer but also longer. \"I think six years is certainly a possibility, five or six years,\" Irsay said. \"There's not a definitive number that I'm stuck on. You don't know how much longer he can play. You hope that it's five years, maybe six years. Until you get longer down the road, it's really uncertain.\" Irsay's comments came two days after Indy used the exclusive franchise tag to keep the only four-time MVP in league history off the free-agent market. Peyton Manning, who turns 35 next month, will not be allowed to negotiate with other teams. If he plays under the tag next season, Peyton Manning would make about $23 million. Betting a long-term deal done quickly could serve three key purposes: lowering Peyton Manning's one-year salary cap number, putting more money in Peyton Manning's pocket right away because of large bonuses, and giving the Colts room to keep other key players around their star quarterback. For more than a year, Irsay promised to make Peyton Manning the highest-paid player in league history. Apparently, Peyton Manning's agent, Tom Condon, now has the proof. \"The contracts out there have been compared and Tom Brady and him have been sort of tied at the hip,\" Irsay said. \"I've made an offer higher than that contract.\" Irsay did not say how much the current offer is worth. So when will all this get resolved? Irsay said negotiations were \"going well\" and reminded fans he took a similar tack in 2004 -- giving Peyton Manning the exclusive franchise tag -- before signing him to a seven-year, $98 million deal in March. Indy then rescinded the designation. The sequel could play out the same way. While Irsay remains hopeful the two sides can work out a deal before the collective bargaining agreement expires March 3, he's prepared to have talks linger into the summer. \"I would like to see something get done before then,\" Irsay said. \"But there's two sides to the negotiations, so either side can only go as fast as the other side. The sooner, the better yes. But if it doesn't get done before then, we can get things done this summer.\" Peyton Manning repeatedly declined to comment on his contract situation during the season, and Condon told The Associated Press last month he expected the two sides to reach agreement, though he didn't establish a timetable. That's not the only contract issue Irsay is dealing with this winter. Irsay acknowledged he has opened negotiations to extend the contract of Adam Vinatieri, considered the best clutch kicker in league history. Adam Vinatieri, running back Joseph Addai and linebacker Clint Session are among a long list of Colts players who could hit free agency once the owners and players reach a settlement. And Irsay is still trying to decide what to do with safety Bob Sanders, the 2007 NFL defensive player of the year. Sanders signed a five-year, $37.5 million contract after the 2007 season, but injuries have limited him to just nine regular-season games the last three seasons. \"Before March third, I think we'll probably have some sense on that direction,\" Irsay said. \"Again, there's nothing definitive. We've talked through a lot of different scenarios, I can't say definitively what direction we're going there.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6133495", "Entities": ["Peyton Manning", "Colts", "Tom Brady", "Adam Vinatieri", "Joseph Addai"]}, {"title": "Sources: Jon Bon Jovi in Falcons talks", "author": "Chris Mortensen", "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "New Jersey rock star Jon Bon Jovi has been in confidential negotiations with Falcons owner Arthur Blank in which Bon Jovi would purchase 15 percent of the NFL franchise for $150 million, according to league sources.

He would not elaborate, except to add that he did not think it was newsworthy at this stage. Bon Jovi released a statement on Monday where he also admitted discussions had taken place but that there is nothing immediately on the horizon. \"Some months ago, I was approached by the Falcons and there have been discussions regarding my ownership interest,\" the statement said. \"At this time, there are no further negotiations with the Falcons.\" Blank is among a select group of owners who have been seeking more minority partners to gain an infusion of cash that in Blank's case will also help him realize his plans to build a new outdoor stadium in the Falcons area.

Some 1,000 fans who attended the Super Bowl have filed a class-action suit against the NFL and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, claiming they ruined their Super Bowl experience. The fans are upset because when they showed up for the Super Bowl with tickets, they discovered they didn't have a seat. Well, at least not a safe one, according to officials. But the moral of this story isn't that the NFL screwed up, or that these fans decided to exact revenge in a manner so typical of our lawsuit-loving culture. The bigger issue here is how gigantic sporting events like the Super Bowl are becoming increasingly out of reach for the everyman, or rather the everyfan. The Super Bowl isn't the ultimate fan experience. It's the ultimate anti-fan experience. I've been to five Super Bowls and after every one, I have the same thought: What exactly does an average fan get out of this? The Super Bowl has become so overpriced, excessive and corporate that it's not worth giving up your spot on the couch or your bar stool. The media is accommodated. Corporate bigwigs, celebrities and other athletes are pampered. Average fans, though, are just tolerated. Of course, it's not that way for everyone. Some fans go to the Super Bowl and have a great time. The NFL tries to stay somewhat connected to the everyfan with the \"NFL Experience,\" a fan festival at a nearby convention center with interactive games, free football clinics and other bells and whistles that allow fans to enjoy a taste of the Super Bowl, whether they are attending the game or not. But considering the average price for a face-value ticket for Super Bowl XLV was $900 -- 12.5 percent more than last year's -- it's obvious that the real NFL experience is making a mortgage payment to attend the big game. And fans not lucky enough to get a face-value ticket could buy one on the secondary market for the price of a small Hyundai. On the league's sanctioned site, the average price for a resold ticket was $4,119. How long before fans are paying $5 just to breathe at the game? If you think I'm being dramatic, keep in mind the people who paid $200 to stand inside the stadium and those who paid $1,000 at a nearby business for parking. So no, it's not surprising that the NFL and Jerry Jones became so obsessed with breaking the Super Bowl attendance record that they didn't acknowledge until the last minute that the temporary seating area was not only unsafe but unfinished. The Super Bowl is just one enormous \"ka-ching!\" Who cares about the details? With the collective bargaining agreement expiring March 4, this was the wrong time for the NFL to have a public relations fiasco involving fans. For weeks, all fans have heard is how the NFL and the players are trying to hammer out an agreement because they have the fans' best interests in mind. That seems a little hollow now, as does today's brinkmanship. I'll give the NFL credit for trying to make amends. They've offered each displaced fan either three times the face value of the ticket ($2,400) and a ticket to next season's Super Bowl, or a ticket, airfare and hotel for a future Super Bowl of the fan's choosing. But apparently, the only thing that will mend some of those fans' battered souls is $5 million in damages. There's nothing like combating greed with even more greed. If the NFL really wanted to do something impressive for fans, the league would make the Super Bowl less about appealing to corporate dollars and keep the tickets' face value reasonable. As it is, the ticket prices in the secondary market for this Super Bowl were the highest on record. Ten years from now, forget about tickets costing the same as a small Hyundai. They will cost as much as a Mercedes. Jemele Hill can be reached at jemeleespn@gmail.com.

The Packers also went into halftime Sunday night without cornerback Sam Shields, who injured a shoulder, while safety Nick Collins went to the locker room early to receive intravenous fluids. Sam Shields and Nick Collins both returned in the second half against the Steelers. Charles Woodson injured his left collarbone in the second quarter. The injuries to him and Sam Shields left the Packers vulnerable on a scoring drive by Steelers that cut Packers's lead to 21-10 at the half. Charles Woodson attempted to address the team at halftime but became so emotional he couldn't do it. \"I just asked the guys to understand how much I wanted it,\" Charles Woodson said after the game. \"That's all he could get out,\" Packers linebacker Desmond Bishop said. \"He was all choked up, and there was just something about it that motivated all of us.\" Charles Woodson was later shown during the telecast attempting to lift his right arm on the sideline, and immediately wincing in pain. Both teams lost wide receivers to injuries early, as the Steelers' Emmanuel Sanders left the game with a foot injury and the Packers' Donald Driver went to the locker room with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative on Donald Driver's ankle, but he was later ruled out. \"We've been a team that's overcome adversity all year,\" Packers wide receiver Greg Jennings said, who noted injuries to Charles Woodson and Donald Driver. \"Our head captain goes down, emotional in the locker room. Our number 1 receiver goes down, more emotions are going, flying in the locker room. But we find a way to bottle it up and exert it all out here on the field.\" Emmanuel Sanders left with a foot injury and the team said he would not return after making a 13-yard catch early in the second quarter. He was taken off the field on a cart. Donald Driver's leg buckled on a hard hit by Steelers's James Farrior and James Harrison in the second quarter. Steelers cornerback Bryant McFadden injured a hip in the first quarter but was able to return. Offensive tackle Flozell Adams injured his shoulder in the opening quarter when teammate Chris Kemoeatu slammed into his back during Nick Collins' 37-yard interception return for a touchdown that gave Packers a 14-0 lead with 3:20 remaining. Flozell Adams was replaced by Trai Essex at right tackle for a few plays before returning to start the second quarter. \"We have a lot of practice at this type of situation,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"And it definitely paid off. No one blinked.... It was like a heavyweight fight. They had delivered a bunch of blows to us, and we had cut them. Good fighters and good boxers, they keep pounding away at the cut. We knew they would come after us. \"Sometimes it's not as clean as you want, but at the end of the day we're Super Bowl champions.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6096580", "Entities": ["Packers", "Charles Woodson", "Steelers", "Sam Shields", "Nick Collins", "Desmond Bishop", "Emmanuel Sanders", "Donald Driver", "Greg Jennings", "James Farrior", "James Harrison", "Bryant McFadden", "Flozell Adams", "Chris Kemoeatu", "Mike McCarthy"]}, {"title": "Former Jet Green makes play of his life", "author": "Rich Cimini", "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Three months ago, Howard Green was released by the Jets because he was too fat. Maybe he was, but the big man ended his improbable season Sunday night as a Super Bowl champion. Not only that, but Green -- a 350-pound defensive lineman -- made a key play in the Packers' 31-25 victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. A bull-rushing Green hit Ben Roethlisberger's throwing arm in the first quarter, resulting in a wobbly pass that was intercepted and returned 37 yards for a touchdown by Nick Collins. It was a storybook ending to Green's season. \"One simple word: perseverance,\" Green said nearly an hour after the game, still in full uniform as he walked on the field at Cowboys Stadium. \"I had to deal with some tough things, some ups and downs. The Jets cut me for whatever reason. That's not an issue anymore. \"I appreciate them for giving me the opportunity, but I'm a Packer now and we just won the Super Bowl. That's all I need to say about that.\" That's saying plenty. When Green was released in late October, he was so distraught that he felt he needed time to clear his head. So instead of flying back to his home in Louisiana, he got in his Ford truck and made the 18-hour drive from New Jersey. When he crossed the Mississippi border, he received a call from his agent, informing him he had been claimed on waivers by the Packers. Turns out the Packers were playing the Jets that weekend. Green played in the game and ended up making a key play, tackling Jerricho Cotchery for a loss on a reverse. He became an important part of the Packers' defensive-line rotation. With 3:34 left in the first quarter Sunday, Green made the play of his life. He used a power rush on left guard Chris Kemoeatu, pushing the 344-pound lineman backward. It was a mountain moving a mountain, but Green got close enough to take a whack at Ben Roethlisberger's arm. \"Yeah, he got ahold of my arm,\" Ben Roethlisberger said, \"but I don't make excuses.\" Green studied Chris Kemoeatu on film and noticed that he tends to sit back in his pass-protection stance. The big fella attacked. \"I had a good get-off and I saw him leaning back in his stance,\" Green said. \"I got into him and bulled him. I thought I sacked him, but he got rid of the ball. Actually, it worked out better that I didn't get the sack.\" All things considered, it couldn't have worked out any better -- the play, the game and his season.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/columns/story?columnist=cimini_rich&id=6097670", "Entities": ["Jets", "Packers", "Steelers", "Ben Roethlisberger", "Nick Collins", "Cowboys", "Chris Kemoeatu"]}, {"title": "Fantasy football injury outlooks for Week 4: Sorting out Seahawks's injuries", "author": "Stephania Bell", "date": "Oct 1, 2017", "content": "Injury concerns regarding players heading into the Sunday and Monday games can be critical. Each Saturday this entry will be dedicated to those who appear on the official weekly NFL game status injury report and how their status may impact fantasy teams. For those who may be new to this blog: Injury reports provide some insight to a player's status. The NFL requires teams to submit practice injury reports several times a week, identifying the body part that is involved in the injury. This year, there has been a change in the language of injury reporting, per the league office. The most notable change is the removal of the probable designation. For more detailed information on the changes and what they mean, click here. Early in the week, the practice injury reports indicate whether a player did not practice, was limited in practice or was a full participant in practice. On Fridays, all teams file a game status injury report assigning one of the following designations: questionable, doubtful or out. The designations listed here reflect the injury reports filed with the league office on Friday evening. Teams playing on Monday night do not have to issue their designations until Saturday. The explanation for each designation is as follows. Out: This is the easy one; the guy's not playing Sunday. Questionable (Q): This remains the most dreaded player designation. By definition it means a player is \u201cuncertain to play.\u201d How uncertain is uncertain? There is no percentage or measurement scale leaving this classification rather vague. Whether a player ends up active or inactive often comes down to a game-time decision based on how he feels on game-day morning or how he performs during warm-ups. Final inactives are due 90 minutes before kickoff. Doubtful (D): The doubtful designation means a player is unlikely to play that week. Rarely does a player labeled as doubtful end up playing, unless he experiences a major turnaround before game time. Each week in the Saturday blog, we run down a list of key fantasy players, by position, who appear in the Friday injury report along with the injured body part as listed on the report, player status and any relevant developments or insight. The primary fantasy positions are covered (quarterback, running back, wide receiver and tight end). This year there at the end of each positional section, there is a subgrouping of players, \u201cPlayers Off Game Status Injury Report.\u201d The probable tag no longer exists so players who would have been listed as probable in previous years are now simply removed from the report. This means there will be players who appear in the practice injury reports during the week, but will not appear on the game status report Friday since they are presumed active for gameday. They are included in this blog so that fantasy owners can see where players who were on the practice injury report during the week have been upgraded in advance of the games. At the end, key fantasy players listed Friday as \"Out\" for the week's games will appear as a group. The Bears and the Packers played on Thursday night, but everyone else is playing this weekend and their fantasy-relevant injured players are represented here. Also, there is an early start Sunday (9:30 a.m. ET) for the two teams playing in London this week: The Saints \u201cvisit\u201d the Dolphins. Good luck in Week 4, everyone! Rob Kelley, Redskins, rib, (Q) : Kelley did not play last week after suffering a rib (chondral) cartilage injury in Week 2, but he appears on track to return for Monday night\u2019s game in Arrowhead Stadium. Kelley was able to practice on a limited basis Thursday and Friday, and the additional week of rest undoubtedly did him some good with regard to his overall discomfort. These injuries are slow to heal and Kelley may be navigating intermittent rest during the week in order to play on weekends. The schedule works in Kelley\u2019s favor, however, as the team has a bye in Week 5. The questionable designation conveys the possibility that Kelley could sit out again this week, but given that he was eager to return to practice just three days after suffering the injury and has participated in every practice since, it\u2019s more likely he takes the field. He would likely wear rib pads for extra protection and his ability to endure four quarters of contact is unknown, but it seems he will have a chance to find out. C.J. Prosise, Seahawks, ankle, (D) : Prosise was a nonparticipant in practice throughout the week because of an ankle injury and is not expected to play. The rotating backfield of the Seahawks adds another twist this week if Prosise sits. Doug Baldwin, Seahawks, groin, (Q) : Doug Baldwin suffered a groin strain in the Week 3 game that became progressively worse and forced a fourth-quarter exit. Doug Baldwin did not return to action. He was a nonparticipant in practice Wednesday and Thursday, but did participate Friday for limited work. Doug Baldwin had expressed optimism earlier in the week that he would be able to take the field Sunday night and reiterated his stance on Friday after practice, but coach Pete Carroll would only call him a game-time decision. In other words, wait and see what happens during the 48 hours between Friday practice and a night game Sunday. Unfortunately, the true test of health comes only when the athlete elevates to game speed, regardless of how well a player is feeling when going through drills, routes or warm-ups. Whether or not the Seahawks are willing to take a chance with Doug Baldwin when the Colts come to Century Link Field on Sunday night won\u2019t be official until about 90 minutes before kickoff. Jordan Reed, Redskins, rib/sternum, (Q) : Reed entered last week\u2019s contest as a game-time decision with an injury to his sternoclavicular (SC) joint and appears as if he will do the same this week. There were hints prior to the Week 3 game that Reed was more likely to sit than to play, including the severity of the pain he described, as well as his lack of participation in blocking drills which would have undoubtedly aggravated that pain. This week, his improved participation in practice would seem to signal a much better chance for Reed to play. Listed as a limited practice participant throughout the week, Reed took part in blocking drills and portions of team practice Thursday, according to ESPN.com\u2019s John Keim. Following Saturday\u2019s practice session, Reed again expressed optimism about his status for Monday. The team has a bye in Week 5, and while coach Jay Gruden stated that will not factor into Reed\u2019s game status for Monday, it is certainly something comforting to look forward to for a player attempting to return from a painful injury. Reed made it clear that his inability to perform all his duties at tight end last week factored into the decision to rest; his improvement in those areas at practice certainly elevate his chances to take the field Monday night against the Chiefs. Players Off Game Status Injury Report: Jimmy Graham, Seahawks, ankle : Jimmy Graham escaped what could have been a serious injury for his left ankle when he was rolled up on from behind in Week 2. After just one day of practice last week, Jimmy Graham returned to action despite a questionable designation and managed to catch seven balls for 72 yards, his best performance of the season. After a day of rest on Wednesday, Jimmy Graham returned to full practices for the remainder of the week. His removal from the pregame injury report removes doubt from his status for this Sunday night contest against the Colts. Jack Doyle, Colts, foot : Doyle was limited in Wednesday and Thursday practices because of his foot, but he returned to full practice on Friday. The Colts removed him from the game status injury report, which is helpful as the Colts don\u2019t play until Sunday night in Seahawks. This space is intended for a list of key players, not including those who have been moved to injured reserve status, who are officially listed as \"Out\" for the upcoming game. Sam Bradford, QB, Vikings, knee : Last week, after Sam Bradford consulted with his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. James Andrews, there was immediate relief that no surgery was required, but it also became apparent that a return to action could take time. Andrews\u2019 recommendations included rest to allow the symptoms to subside, and Sam Bradford\u2019s status was labeled as week-to-week. It is no surprise then that he is not ready to take the field just one week later. In fact, Sam Bradford did not even return to practice, indicating the team is prepared to take a conservative approach with ramping up his activity, perhaps as a part of looking at the bigger picture of a long season. For Week 4, Case Keenum remains at the helm for the Vikings. Tyler Eifert, TE, back, and John Ross, WR, knee, Bengals : ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported earlier this week that Tyler Eifert was expected to miss multiple weeks because of injury, and this will be his second consecutive absence this season. Tyler Eifert has said he has no timetable for return, and it certainly doesn\u2019t sound as if that return will be anytime soon. Ross continues to nurse a knee injury and has not yet returned to practice. He too remains sidelined. Matt Forte, RB, Jets, knee, toe : Matt Forte suffered a turf toe injury in Week 3, and his inability to return to practice by Friday signaled early that he would miss this game. It is expected to be the Bilal Powell show on the ground for the Jets as they host the Jaguars. Corey Davis, WR, Titans, hamstring : Once again, Davis was absent from practice the entire week, and he sits out Week 4 against the Texans. Andrew Luck, QB, Colts, right shoulder : It appeared Andrew Luck might return to practice this week, but ultimately that did not happen. Even after he returns, it will likely take him time to be game ready. ESPN\u2019s Chris Mortensen reported the team was eyeing an approximate target of Week 7. The situation remains fluid. Mike Williams, WR, Los Angeles Chargers, back : Mike Williams continued to participate daily in practice on a limited basis. The consistency with which he has been on the practice field is encouraging, but he will have to increase his involvement before he is declared game ready. Jay Ajayi, Dolphins, knee, (Q) : Ajayi has been listed as questionable for consecutive weeks now because of his knee, yet he has suited up each week. In fact, Ajayi practiced more this week than last. Last week, his only work day was Friday. This week, Ajayi was off on Wednesday, but was listed as a full participant both Thursday and Friday. Oh, incidentally, the Dolphins play in London this week, the city where Ajayi was born. As ESPN.com\u2019s James Delanie Walker notes, this week is a \u201cpersonal celebration\u201d for the young running back who was an injured rookie when the team last played overseas. Expect Ajayi to play, barring a setback. Adrian Peterson, Saints, not injury related : Players listed on the injury report as \u201cnot injury related\u201d don\u2019t usually make this column; most of those players are either veterans getting an off day for rest or players getting a day off from the team for personal reasons. However, those days off usually come on Wednesday. Adrian Peterson\u2019s initial listing as a nonparticipant in practice on a Thursday led to concern that there was an underlying injury, some potential alternative explanation for his lack of production thus far in the season. When the Saints listed his off day as not related to injury, and Adrian Peterson followed that up with a full day Friday, the health concerns were alleviated, at least temporarily. At 32 years old, Adrian Peterson is coming off a season lost to injury following knee surgery to repair his lateral meniscus. It would not be surprising to see him garner off days going forward. Willie Snead, Saints, hamstring, (Q) : Well, it originally looked as though the Saints would see the return of Snead to the playing field Sunday, but his addition to the injury report with a hamstring ailment Friday and his questionable tag heading into Sunday\u2019s game make that far from certain. Integrating with a team after being absent for three weeks is much more difficult when not participating in practice. Likewise, potential aggravation of a hamstring injury that could cause a receiver on the cusp of returning to miss additional extended time could be very costly. It seems as if the Saints have more reasons to give Snead an additional week off than to play him, but the official decision is not expected until game time. As a reminder, this game is being played in London and kicks off at 9:30 a.m. ET. Rex Burkhead, Patriots, ribs, (D) : Burkhead was not able to practice all of last week because of an injury to his ribs and was held out. This week, his first attempt at practice did not come until Friday, and even then it was limited. The rarely used doubtful tag suggests Burkhead will sit out again this week. LeSean McCoy, Bills, wrist : The sore wrist is still enough of a factor for LeSean McCoy to result in his appearing on the practice injury report. It is such a small factor that it hasn\u2019t kept him from missing practice reps. This week, LeSean McCoy was listed as a full participant daily and, as usual, has been removed from the pregame injury report. Giovani Bernard, Bengals, thigh : Bernard was limited both Wednesday and Thursday, but returned to a full practice Friday. The light work earlier in the week may have been largely proactive, given Bernard\u2019s removal from the game status injury report. Isaiah Crowell, shoulder and Duke Johnson Jr., shoulder, Browns : When a team\u2019s top two running backs appear on the injury report simultaneously, it is not a good sign. They were even dealing with injuries to the same region (shoulder). Both backs returned to full practice Friday, and both were removed from the pregame injury report. Crowell and Johnson should both be available when the Browns host the Bengals on Sunday. Alfred Blue, Texans, ankle : Blue keeps making improvements on the injury front. After missing the first two weeks of the season with a high ankle sprain, Blue came into Week 3 with a questionable designation. He didn\u2019t end up on the playing field, but given that his practice participation was limited, it was not a surprise. This week, Blue was integrated into full practice daily and is now removed from the game status injury report. It would appear that from a health perspective, Blue is ready to go. Whether he has an opportunity to play remains to be seen, given the emergence of D\u2019Onta Foreman. Kenny Golladay, Lions, hamstring, (Q) : Golladay has not been much of a factor for the Lions since Week 1 and doesn\u2019t appear as if he will be again this week. Limited to only portions of one practice early in the week, Golladay did not participate in any practice after Wednesday. It\u2019s hard to imagine him taking the field this week or being in tip-top shape if he does. Kelvin Benjamin, Panthers, knee : Benjamin had a scary moment when his left leg got bent underneath him, hyperflexing his knee and putting an extreme stretch on his quad. Benjamin left the game and remained on the sideline, icing his sore knee and thigh. Imaging on his ACL-reconstructed knee came back negative on Monday, and Benjamin quickly progressed from riding the stationary bike on the sideline Wednesday to full practices Thursday and Friday. His removal from the injury report reflects the Panthers\u2019 confidence in Benjamin\u2019s readiness to play. Sammy Watkins, concussion, and Tavon Austin, concussion, Los Angeles Rams : Both Watkins and Austin left the Week 3 game with concussions. The 10-day break between games came at a useful time for the Rams. Both receivers were back in limited fashion on Wednesday, then followed that session with back-to-back full practices. Coach Sean McVay told reporters Thursday that the receiving pair was \u201cgood to go.\u201d Their official removal from the injury report serves as confirmation. Martavis Bryant, Steelers, illness : Bryant was dealing with a stomach virus and headaches this week, which led to consecutive missed practices on Wednesday and Thursday, according to ESPN.com\u2019s Jeremy Fowler. Bryant returned to full practice on Friday and told Fowler he was \u201cgood to go.\u201d His removal from the pregame injury report supports this. Danny Amendola, knee, and Phillip Dorsett, knee, Patriots : Both Danny Amendola and Dorsett were able to play last week after being listed as questionable, with Danny Amendola also recovering from a concussion sustained in Week 1. This week, both players were limited in Wednesday and Thursday practices with an upgrade to full practice on Friday. Their removal from the injury report indicates both are expected to be available again in Week 4. Of note, fellow receiver Chris Hogan was on last week\u2019s injury report with a knee ailment after taking a helmet to the leg in Week 2. He played in Week 3 and was not present on the practice injury report at all this week, suggesting the issue is entirely behind him. Will Fuller, Texans, shoulder : Fuller is coming off surgery to repair a clavicle (collarbone) fracture sustained in the preseason. He has been working his way back in limited practice the past couple of weeks, and this week, he upgraded to full practices daily. Even coach Bill O\u2019Brien, usually quiet when it comes to a player with any type of injury status, indicated earlier in the week that he expected Fuller to play Sunday. Now eight weeks removed from the injury, Fuller will take the field Sunday when the Texans host the Titans. Kenny Britt, Browns, knee : The pattern for Kenny Britt was slightly altered this week. Normally a full participant throughout the week despite appearing on the injury report, Kenny Britt was held out of practice Wednesday and Thursday. He was listed as a full participant on Friday, but the Browns merely conducted a walk-through. Still, Kenny Britt\u2019s removal from the injury report indicates the team expects to have him available Sunday. Delanie Walker, Titans, hamstring : Delanie Walker was listed as a nonparticipant in Wednesday\u2019s practice with a sore hamstring. His return to full practices both Thursday and Friday removed the uncertainty from his status. Delanie Walker\u2019s removal from the pregame injury report cements his availability. Melvin Gordon, Los Angeles Chargers, knee, (Q) : Gordon was a late (Thursday) addition to the injury report in Week 3 with soreness in his left knee, raising concern on two levels: His left knee is the one on which he underwent microfracture surgery in early 2016 and a late-week problem is never encouraging. Gordon was active in Week 3, but he was forced to exit the game for a period of time because of the knee. He returned to finish out the game, but the worries about his knee health were elevated given the midgame exit. This week, Gordon was given Wednesday off to rest the knee, but he did return to practice on Thursday. Both Gordon and head coach Anthony Lynn expressed optimism about his availability for this Sunday\u2019s contest against the Eagles and Gordon\u2019s listing as a full practice participant Friday was encouraging, despite the fact that it was a light workout. Still, the questionable tag by definition indicates uncertainty about his status, and things can change -- for better or worse -- overnight. While Gordon is expected to play, fantasy owners should have an alternate plan in place as a precaution. This is a late afternoon game (4:05 p.m. ET start). Carlos Hyde, 49ers, hip, (Q) : Hyde, who was hurt in the Week 3 game against the Rams, originally was listed as questionable to return with a left hip injury. But return he did, finishing the game with a solid performance that included two touchdowns. It wasn\u2019t especially surprising that Hyde was limited in practice early in the week, but when he remained limited at the end the week, his status for the game appeared less certain. On Friday, coach Kyle Shanahan indicated Hyde would be a game-time decision (never easy for fantasy owners when it is a 4:05 p.m. ET kickoff). Interestingly, when speaking with reporters post-practice Friday, Shanahan referenced an oblique injury for Hyde. An injury to the oblique muscles, which are part of the abdominal core musculature, can be very painful and limiting when it comes to rotational movement or with power activities such as explosive running or jumping. There is no doubt Hyde is dealing with some pain; the question becomes whether he can be effective in the presence of the discomfort. Given his performance last Thursday night, the concerns about effectiveness are somewhat alleviated and would suggest that Hyde, ultimately, will play. The bigger-picture concern is whether Hyde will be able to adequately recover if he does continue to play uninterrupted. The 49ers' bye does not come until mid-November in Week 11, so there is no built-in opportunity to rest for nearly two months. This will likely be a situation to monitor for a while. Michael Crabtree, Raiders, chest, (D) : Michael Crabtree suffered a chest injury in Week 3 as he was hit going up to attempt to catch a pass. While X-rays were reported to be negative, and as coach Jack Del Jack Del Rio pointed out, Michael Crabtree was given medical clearance to return home with the team following the game (indicating no serious lung or other internal organ injury that would prevent flying), he appears to remain limited by the injury, and his status is uncertain. Michael Crabtree practiced on only a limited basis Wednesday and Thursday, then was absent entirely from Friday\u2019s practice, a topic Del Jack Del Rio declined to elaborate on when questioned by reporters. The combination of the nature of his injury, the late absence from practice (albeit for unclear reasons) and the prospect of facing a strong Broncos defense -- in Broncos -- for a late afternoon game stacks the odds against Michael Crabtree heading into Sunday\u2019s contest. ( Note: On Saturday night, the Raiders downgraded Michael Crabtree from questionable to doubtful. It now appears Michael Crabtree will sit out Sunday's game.) John Brown, quadriceps, and J.J. Nelson, hamstring, Cardinals, (Q) : Last week, coach Bruce Arians said it would have been miraculous if Brown suited up. As expected, he did not. It certainly seemed as if he were still quite a ways from returning. Interestingly, his activity has picked up in practice this week, and now there is a reasonable possibility that Brown returns to the playing field. After taking part in portions of practice daily, Brown is listed as questionable, but coach Bruce Arians indicated he is expected to play. Just what that workload looks like in what will be Brown\u2019s second game of the regular season is unknown although Bruce Arians made it clear it will be limited. Meanwhile, his teammate J.J. Nelson was active Monday night despite a hamstring injury, but his productivity was a sharp contrast from the prior week. In Week 2, Nelson recorded five catches for 120 yards and a score; in Week 3 he had zero catches and was targeted just three times. Nelson remained limited throughout the week in practice and may be limited in volume again in Sunday\u2019s game. Amari Cooper, Raiders, knee : Cooper has been an injury report staple, and this week is no different. Limited reps on Wednesday are followed by full practices on Thursday and Friday with removal from the game status injury report. There are far more questions about the availability of Cooper\u2019s teammate, Michael Crabtree, this week.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/blog/stephania-bell/", "Entities": ["Bears", "Packers", "Saints", "Dolphins", "Redskins", "Seahawks", "Doug Baldwin", "Pete Carroll", "Colts", "Chiefs", "Jimmy Graham", "Sam Bradford", "Vikings", "Case Keenum", "Tyler Eifert", "Bengals", "Matt Forte", "Jets", "Bilal Powell", "Jaguars", "Titans", "Texans", "Andrew Luck", "Mike Williams", "Chargers", "Delanie Walker", "Adrian Peterson", "Patriots", "LeSean McCoy", "Bills", "Browns", "Lions", "Panthers", "Rams", "Steelers", "Danny Amendola", "Kenny Britt", "Eagles", "49ers", "Michael Crabtree", "Raiders", "Jack Del Rio", "Broncos", "Cardinals", "Bruce Arians"]}, {"title": "Will Browns trade up for Mariota?", "author": "Adam Schefter", "date": "Apr 15, 2015", "content": "ESPN Insider Adam Schefter hits five of the biggest questions around the league once a week during the NFL preseason and regular season, and sporadically throughout the playoffs and offseason. Have a query of your own? Submit it here. Which team is most likely to trade up to draft Marcus Mariota? I never want to label a team as the \u201cmost likely\u201d to trade up because at this time of year, teams do their best to mask their intentions. Just think back to last year; no one would have thought the Jaguars were the \u201cmost likely\u201d to draft quarterback Blake Bortles. But it would be easy to label the Browns as a team, if not the team, to monitor in relation to Marcus Mariota. It's hard to imagine the Browns don\u2019t at least have discussions about what it would take to come up to get Mariota. Few teams have the ammunition they do. For starters, Browns has the 12th and 19th overall picks, and it probably would have to throw in at least next year\u2019s first-rounder to get up to take Mariota. But teams want to see which players slide, who\u2019s available, at what slot, at what value and then make a deal; it\u2019s hard to imagine you\u2019ll see a pre-draft trade. More often than not, these trades happen while a team is on the clock. The Jets, Bears, Rams could all have an interest in Mariota, but Browns is a team to pay attention to here. Who are a couple of players front offices feel are overvalued right now? It's hard to say, because you never know how every team values certain players. But in a not especially strong group of corners, Michigan State cornerback Trae Waynes has that feel for someone who is so wiry and lean. Some believe he is the top-rated cornerback, but I\u2019ve heard other teams in recent weeks speak better about the talents of both Marcus Peters and Kevin Johnson as well. Peters and Johnson might go a bit higher than people think while Waynes doesn\u2019t go quite as high. Also, Maxx Williams is thought of as the top tight end, but it\u2019s such a weak crop of tight ends in this year\u2019s draft that his value is being inflated more by the lack of quality at the position. What do you believe the resolution of the Adrian Peterson solution will be? Is there any chance he\u2019s actually traded from the Vikings? The Vikings certainly want and intend for him to play for Vikings again. It will be up to some other team like Cardinals or Cowboys to debate whether it\u2019s worth it to try to change Vikings\u2019s mind. Right now the Vikings would like Adrian Peterson to play for them this season, and they have no plans to trade him. But if another team comes calling with an enticing enough package, it would be silly not to at least listen. My sense right now -- subject to change -- is that Adrian Peterson will play this season for the Vikings. But we\u2019ll all know a lot more after the draft.

Chad Henne threw for a career-high 335 yards and directed a 51-yard drive for the winning field goal with 1:02 left, lifting Dolphins past Patriots 22-21. Davone Bess, a second-year wideout, also had a big day, catching 10 passes for 117 yards and one touchdown. Gradkowski Bruce Gradkowski: Gradkowski might be more than just a short-term solution for the Raiders. Gradkowski threw for a career-high 308 yards and three TDs, including a pair to Louis Murphy in the final six minutes, to lead Raiders to a 27-24 victory at Steelers. Gradkowski and Louis Murphy connected on the game-winning scoring strike, an 11-yarder, with nine seconds left. Jason Campbell Jason Campbell: The Redskins lost a heartbreaker to Saints, but Jason Campbell enjoyed his most productive game of the season. Jason Campbell completed 30 of 42 passes for 367 yards and three touchdowns (he also had one interception) in Redskins's 33-30 overtime loss. The Redskins racked up 455 yards of total offense, a season high. Robert Meachem Robert Meachem: Robert Meachem set career highs in receptions (eight) and receiving yards (142), and had two TDs in the Saints' victory. Robert Meachem's first score was one for the highlight reel. In the second quarter, Redskins's Kareem Moore intercepted a Drew Brees pass and ran 14 yards before Robert Meachem stripped the ball and sprinted down the sideline for a 44-yard TD. Ochocinco Chad Ochocinco: Ochocinco has been urging the Bengals to throw more -- especially downfield. Bengals heeded his advice on Sunday. Ochocinco caught nine passes for a season-high 137 yards and one TD in the Bengals' 23-13 victory over Lions. It was Ochocinco's first 100-yard receiving game since Week 7 and his highest receiving yardage total since Sept. 23, 2007 (against Seahawks). Jason Witten Jason Witten: The Cowboys generated 424 yards of offense -- and fell short. Although the Giants handed Cowboys a 31-24 loss, they couldn't slow Jason Witten, who repeatedly found open space in New York's defense. Jason Witten included his 500th career catch among a career-best 14 receptions for 156 yards. Broncos The Broncos' running game: The two-headed rushing attack of Correll Buckhalter and Knowshon Moreno helped the Broncos roll over the Chiefs. Buckhalter ran for 113 yards on only 12 carries and Knowshon Moreno rushed for 86 yards and two touchdowns, powering Broncos to a 44-13 victory. Larry Fitzgerald Larry Fitzgerald/Anquan Boldin: Speaking of two-headed attacks, the Cardinals had one of their own against Vikings. Larry Fitzgerald (8 catches, 143 yards, one TD) and Anquan Boldin (7 catches, 98 yards, 2 TDs) helped Cardinals cruise to a 30-17 victory. Tom Brady Tom Brady : Tom Brady a dud? It doesn't happen very often, but Tom Brady qualified on Sunday, despite throwing for 352 yards in the Patriots' 22-21 loss in Dolphins. Trying to extend Patriots's 21-19 lead late in the fourth quarter, Tom Brady was intercepted in the end zone by rookie Vontae Davis. After Dolphins kicked the go-ahead field goal with 1:02 remaining, Tom Brady threw a second pick, which sealed Patriots's second straight loss. Adrian Peterson Adrian Peterson: Another player who hardly ever finds himself on this list, Adrian Peterson was shut down by the Cardinals. Adrian Peterson rushed for a season-low 19 yards on 13 carries (a 1.5-yard average) in the Vikings' 30-17 loss to Cardinals. Adrian Peterson had rushed for at least 55 yards in every game this season. Shaun Suisham Shaun Suisham: The Redskins were headed toward an emotional home victory over the undefeated Saints. But Shaun Suisham couldn't close the deal. With the Redskins leading 30-23 late in regulation, Shaun Suisham was wide right on a gimme 23-yard field goal attempt that would have iced the victory for Redskins. The miss opened the door for Drew Brees and the Saints, who rallied for an overtime victory. Josh Freeman Josh Freeman: Josh Freeman threw five interceptions -- three near the goal line -- in the Buccaneers' 16-6 loss to Panthers. The rookie's biggest error came on fourth-and-goal from the Panthers' 2-yard line with Buccaneers trailing 13-6 early in the fourth quarter. Josh Freeman's pass into the end zone was picked off by Chris Harris. Rams The Rams' offense: Besides Steven Jackson, there are very few bright spots for the Rams. Steven Jackson rushed for 112 yards in Rams' 17-9 loss to Bears, but the Rams' offense was feeble as a whole. The Rams were 2-of-14 on third-down conversions, and QB Kyle Boller threw for just 113 yards and got sacked three times.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?page=studs09/week13", "Entities": ["Chad Henne", "Davone Bess", "Dolphins", "Patriots", "Raiders", "Louis Murphy", "Steelers", "Jason Campbell", "Redskins", "Saints", "Robert Meachem", "Kareem Moore", "Drew Brees", "Bengals", "Lions", "Seahawks", "Jason Witten", "Cowboys", "Giants", "Broncos", "Knowshon Moreno", "Chiefs", "Larry Fitzgerald", "Anquan Boldin", "Cardinals", "Vikings", "Tom Brady", "Vontae Davis", "Adrian Peterson", "Shaun Suisham", "Josh Freeman", "Buccaneers", "Panthers", "Chris Harris", "Rams", "Steven Jackson", "Bears"]}, {"title": "Graying expectations", "author": "Bill Barnwell", "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "Terrell Owens is fond of referring to his newfound pairing with Chad Ochocinco as \"Batman and Robin.\" This may end up being a particularly inspired metaphor from the two-time published author. In the movies, when the actor playing Batman gets too old or expensive to reliably play the part, the production company replaces him with a newer, younger model. Terrell Owens and Ochocinco represent one of the oldest wide receiver one-two punches in recent NFL history; by looking at how similarly aged units have done in the past, we can see if the Bengals should expect to put out a casting call for a new wideout this offseason. (We must dismiss one argument quickly. Some will say that because these WRs have such a great track record they are able to play at this age, to which the response is: That goes for all the comparisons, as well.) If we define a team's top two wideouts as the two wide receivers with the most catches for a team in a given season, there's been only three units as old or older since the strike season of 1983. First, the facts. Ochocinco turned treinta y dos (32) in January. Terrell Owens turns 37 at the beginning of December. Combine those two figures and you get a pair of starting wideouts with 69 years between them.

A 2009 third-round pick, McKenzie was waived by the team on Sunday to make room for veteran linebacker Tracy White, who is considered a strong special teams player. Had McKenzie been waived one day earlier, he could have had a greater chance of being claimed by another team. But with most teams setting their 53-man rosters and shifting their preparations for the season opener into a higher gear, McKenzie slipped through. The Patriots also announced that they have signed rookie running back Javarris James and rookie tight end Jeron Mastrud to their practice squad.

Leinart will take a physical, sign the contract and join the team Monday. Agent Tom Condon confirmed the agreement in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \"It's been kind of crazy, a whirlwind, but I'm excited to be here,\" Leinart told KRIV-TV in Texans. Leinart said he's looking forward to working with Texans coach Gary Kubiak, who has a reputation for developing quarterbacks. \"I am really excited to work with Gary,\" Leinart told KRIV. \"His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with quarterbacks and what he's done with Matt [Schaub] is really intriguing. Matt is a great quarterback to learn from and I'm really looking forward to it.\" Leinart's deal with the Texans was first reported by ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen. After his release Saturday, Leinart found little interest from the rest of the NFL's 31 teams, sources told Mortensen. Leinart will become the Texans' third quarterback behind Schaub, the starter, and backup Dan Orlovsky, who will remain the number 2 at least until Leinart has some command of Texans's offensive scheme, the sources said. The Texans cut John David Booty, another former USC quarterback, when they trimmed their roster to the mandatory 53-man limit on Saturday, leaving Schaub and Orlovsky as their top two quarterbacks. Orlovsky threw two interceptions against the Buccaneers in the final preseason game but Gary Kubiak otherwise described the Texans' backup as having a \"strong\" training camp. Gary Kubiak said he was excited to add Leinart to his stable of quarterbacks. \"You don't count on a player like that being available,\" Gary Kubiak told KRIV. \"We are very fortunate. Matt fits what we do.\" Leinart will be working with some of the NFL's best receiving talent, including All-Pro Andre Johnson. Leinart, who was released Saturday, also had great receivers in Cardinals, led by All-Pro Larry Fitzgerald. Leinart's financial terms for 2010 were not immediately available. The Cardinals parted ways with the former Heisman Trophy winner days after Leinart went public with his frustration over being replaced by Browns castoff Derek Anderson. Leinart complained he had outplayed Derek Anderson and that his problems with coach Ken Whisenhunt were \"probably away from football.\" That led to a meeting with Ken Whisenhunt the following day. Although he was unhappy that Leinart took his issues public, Ken Whisenhunt praised how the quarterback handled things. \"The one thing I want to make very clear is how professional Matt was about the whole situation,\" the coach said. \"I was very impressed with his conversation with me. He thanked the organization, the ownership, for all the time and effort that they had invested in him. He felt like he had gotten better and he had learned a lot and it meant a lot to me to hear him say that.\" Cardinals thought it had a steal when Leinart, who led Southern California to two national championships and a third title game appearance, fell to the Cardinals at the number 10 overall pick in 2006. He started 11 games as a rookie under then-coach Dennis Green, then the first five the following season under new coach Ken Whisenhunt. But the big left-hander went down with a broken collarbone and Kurt Warner took over. Warner finished his career with two spectacular seasons, leading Cardinals to consecutive NFC West titles, an incredible run to the Super Bowl and a 51-45 overtime victory over Packers in a playoff thriller last season. Leinart threw for 3,893 yards with 14 touchdowns and 20 interceptions with Cardinals. He's eager to prove that he belongs in the NFL now that he's received a second chance with the Texans. \"I know I can play,\" Leinart told KRIV. \"I know I can have success in this league. I know I am not going to be handed anything. I've been in the same [offensive] system the last four years and now I'm excited to be a part of a new one.\" Information from ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen and The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5538812", "Entities": ["Cardinals", "Texans", "Gary Kubiak", "Buccaneers", "Andre Johnson", "Larry Fitzgerald", "Browns", "Derek Anderson", "Ken Whisenhunt", "Packers"]}, {"title": "Jets are on the money with Revis deal", "author": "Ian O'Connor", "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "Go ahead, feel free to take the Jets seriously for the first time in months. Trust them. Embrace them. Consider them capable of landing in the Super Bowl for the first time since man landed on the moon. Until the small hours of Labor Day, the Jets gave you their version of April Fools' Day over and over and over again. They swore through straight faces they could win it all without Darrelle Revis, and no, the claim wouldn't have inspired Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum's hero, Red Auerbach, to light any cigar. The Jets weren't kidding anyone but themselves. Without Darrelle Revis, the best defensive player in the NFL, the best in the marketplace since Lawrence Taylor, the Jets would've been a haunted 8-8 team, or something to that effect. They had to make the four-year deal that they announced early Monday morning with their battered fan base fast asleep. Owner Woody Johnson and coach Rex Ryan had to go to Florida to meet with Darrelle Revis and his uncle, Sean Gilbert, the former NFL lineman, and they had to get their megastar cornerback in helmet and pads before opening night next Monday against the Ravens. \"It was an incredible gesture for Woody to go down and see Darrelle on a Saturday of a three-day weekend,\" Tannenbaum said on a conference call. An incredible gesture? Are you kidding me? If Johnson didn't break up his little holiday to travel to Florida to negotiate with Darrelle Revis, to find some way, any way, to end this camplong stalemate, the owner should've been forced to spend his next two-week Caribbean cruise bunking with Eric Mangini. Johnson's latest coach, Rex Ryan, has all but guaranteed possession of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and much sooner rather than later. \"With Darrelle here, those chances go up,\" Tannenbaum said. Yeah, as in a lot. Rex Ryan's Jets have done so much talking, it became apparent they thought they could filibuster their way to the Super Bowl and to a visit with President Obama in the White House. They loaded up with the win-now likes of Jason Taylor, LaDainian Tomlinson, Santonio Holmes and Antonio Cromartie, and hoped everyone would be too busy laughing at Rex Ryan's language on \"Hard Knocks\" to recall that a holdover Jet far more important than the new recruits was left on the cutting room floor. Darrelle Revis wanted his money, big money, guaranteed money, and he had every right to ask for it. If the NFL doesn't fully guarantee contracts, it does fully guarantee pain, suffering and a heartless exit interview when a team needs a healthier throwing shoulder or a faster set of wheels. Darrelle Revis saw what happened to Leon Redskins after the back tore up his leg, and he saw how the good locker room citizen, Thomas Jones, was rewarded for ripping off 1,400 yards. Darrelle Revis also saw how Kellen Clemens was treated by Tannenbaum in that revealing \"Hard Knocks\" scene the other night, when the GM told the backup quarterback he could take a pay cut or get fired, his choice. An NFL player has to make his score while he can. Darrelle Revis withdrew his services for the summer and waited for the Jets to come to him. Sure enough, billionaire Woody and rebel Rex took their reality-show act on the road, making their desperate moves on Darrelle Revis' home court. Sometime around 11 p.m. Sunday, Tannenbaum said, employer and employee found \"a landing spot that was good for both sides.\" That landing spot would be identified as $46 million. \"I'm comin home baby!!!\" Darrelle Revis wrote on Twitter. Suddenly the GM who helped script the fairy tale that his team would be fine without Darrelle Revis was talking about the corner ending up in the Hall of Fame -- as a Jet, of course. \"I think it's a win-win,\" Tannenbaum said. The Jets haven't won anything yet, other than Darrelle Revis' commitment to sign a four-year contract. Finally the franchise that forever leads the NFL in empty promises has made good on a pledge. The Jets will make for a credible contender on opening night. Darrelle Revis, who makes a living cutting the field in half, just made his team whole. Ian O'Connor is a columnist for ESPNNewYork.com.

Across the practice field, the Jets started to react. A few players started a slow, rhythmic clapping, some chanted \"Darrelle Revis\" like in his series of commercials, and a few others bowed down as though it was the second coming of a man some jokingly call Darrelle Revis Christ. \"Bart Scott was doing the Rudy thing --'Ru-dy, Ru-dy' -- they were so glad to see him,\" said Jets owner Damien Woody Johnson. But Darrelle Revis, wearing shorts and a T-shirt and looking relaxed, never lost their support. Antonio Cromartie said he'd been in touch with Darrelle Revis several times each week that the marquee cornerback held out, although never about the negotiations. Now, the self-described Bart Scottie Pippen said he has his Michael Jordan back, and Antonio Cromartie will move back to the right side of the field. \"I play both sides, so I'm just moving back to my side and my island,\" Antonio Cromartie said. Getting players back in their natural spots will benefit the team, a few players said. \"All the rest of us who have been getting so many valuable reps in training camp, they're back in the position where you kind of expected them to play this season,\" safety Jim Leonhard said. \"It's going to be huge. We're really looking forward to it. We should be able to do a lot of different things in the secondary.\" The only player who didn't exactly seem overjoyed was low-key rookie corner Kyle Wilson, who will go from being a starter to a backup in his first year. He has had the benefit of all the first-team reps during training camp, and he smiled when asked whether he planned to relinquish the spot to Darrelle Revis. \"We'll duke it out before we go to practice tomorrow,\" Kyle Wilson said. Technically, Rex Ryan could choose not to play Darrelle Revis after missing all those days, but the corner is too good to put on a shelf if there are no physical issues to keep him from playing. His part of the field was nicknamed Darrelle Revis Island because wide receivers disappear over there, and opponents scored only eight passing touchdowns against the Jets last season. Antonio Cromartie said that Darrelle Revis kept working out and that it shouldn't take him long to be football-ready. \"It will probably take one game,\" Antonio Cromartie said. \"You have to think they're going to throw the ball, [and Darrelle Revis] will have to run around a little bit more. He's probably going to play more than 55 to 60 plays, so it's a matter of getting the wind up under you. He probably did a great job of doing conditioning and doing the things that he's supposed to do. He's already in great shape.\" Several said that Darrelle Revis was in the unique position of having leverage in the NFL, given his numbers and that Jets coach Rex Ryan lobbied for Darrelle Revis to be named the league's defensive player of the year. Was there anyone who began to begrudge Darrelle Revis for holding out? \"Nope,\" defensive lineman Sione Pouha said. \"That's why we're a different team.\" Darrelle Revis was the third member of the so-called Core Four to have his deal renegotiated upward before the start of the season. Left tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson was the first, followed by center Nick Mangold. Linebacker David Harris is the last but is resigned to collective bargaining agreement restrictions that mean it won't happen until after the season. Nick Mangold said he knew how good it felt for him to complete his own deal. \"It's gotta be good,\" Nick Mangold said. \"It was nice for me; I imagine it would be nice for him.\" Right tackle Damien Woody said he was glad to have Darrelle Revis back, but more so to end the weeks of drama and speculation surrounding the holdout.

The Jets needed three roster spots Sunday after acquiring three players on waivers. They cut wide receiver David Clowney, running back Chauncey Redskins and Tony Richardson -- a move that stunned and angered some players. Those players weren't aware of the team's strategy when they made comments to ESPNNewYork.com. As a vested veteran, Tony Richardson wasn't exposed to waivers. He became a free agent and the Jets were \"very confident\" they'd be able to re-sign him, Rex Ryan said. To make room for Tony Richardson's return, the Jets waived rookie cornerback Brian Jackson. They didn't want to release Jackson on Sunday; they wanted to wait until Darrelle Revis' contract was finalized before cutting a cornerback. By midday, it was apparent that Tony Richardson was coming back. His locker at the Jets' training facility was intact. Everything was still in it, from practice jerseys to shampoo to toothpaste. It didn't look like the locker of a player who was gone for good. In the end, the one day in limbo didn't cost Tony Richardson any pay. If he had been re-signed after Week 1, he would've lost one game check ($50,000) and the balance of his $855,000 wouldn't have been guaranteed. Rex Ryan said Tony Richardson will play against the Ravens in the opener. Some players still were upset that Tony Richardson was used as a pawn in the unconventional chess game. One player said it was a \"[crappy]\" thing to do. Several said they were stunned when they heard the news late Sunday. \"It was jaw-dropping,\" said tight end Dustin Keller, who has the locker next to Tony Richardson. \"I couldn't believe it. He's our top veteran on offense.

Ultimately, Rex Ryan came home with a souvenir. It was a tense and heated negotiation -- Rex Ryan threw a self-described \"tantrum\" Sunday night -- but the Jets welcomed Darrelle Revis back to their team with applause, hugs and good-natured razzing. The star cornerback admitted to having butterflies when he strolled on the field late in practice and was greeted with a \"Rudy\" clap, that slow clap made famous in the inspirational movie. His teammates also chanted his name. \"It was hurting me so bad,\" Darrelle Revis said of his holdout. \"I didn't know how my teammates would accept me when I came back because I wasn't there in training camp. I was in the news every other day, and I'm sure they were tired of hearing my name.\" After reconnecting with his teammates, Darrelle Revis retreated to an upstairs board room, where he signed his new contract. The deal includes $32 million in guarantees, including $7.5 million in total 2010 compensation, according to league sources. It culminated a seven-month odyssey that began when the Jets told Darrelle Revis after the season they wanted to rework his contract, and included two secret negotiation sessions at the Roscoe Diner in upstate New York. According to a source, language in the contract dissuades Darrelle Revis from holding out again. The source said the contract is technically a seven-year deal, but if Darrelle Revis doesn't hold out through 2013, the final three years are voided and he becomes an unrestricted free agent. If Darrelle Revis does hold out, it would remain a seven-year deal, and he'd make $9 million total over those final three years. According to the source, there's also language in the deal that prohibits the Jets from using the franchise tag or transition tag when the contract is up. But for now, the black cloud over the Jets is gone. Now they can get on with the business of trying to reach the Super Bowl. There was relief in every corner of the building, from the locker room to Rex Ryan's office. \"There was an energy in the building and on this team when we knew Darrelle was coming back,\" Rex Ryan said. Nose tackle Kris Jenkins felt the energy. \"The stress is gone,\" Jenkins said. \"My pupils are actually starting to dilate a little bit. It's a natural high right now. I feel so much better because it takes a lot of pressure off us. We're just happy he's back. We're happy we've got our team back.\" Darrelle Revis will be on the practice field Tuesday, and he will be in the starting lineup when the Jets open the season Monday night against the Ravens. He arrived at the Jets' facility around 1 p.m. after an early-morning flight from Ft. Lauderdale, appearing emotionally drained after a long night and a sometimes acrimonious negotiation. \"This experience humbled me very much,\" said Darrelle Revis, who passed the time during his holdout at his homes in Ft. Lauderdale, New Jersey and Aliquippa, Pa. Actually, Rex Ryan, frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations, showed up recently at Darrelle Revis' New Jersey home, hoping for a sitdown. But his best defensive player wasn't home. Last Friday, he and owner Woody Johnson decided to fly to Ft. Lauderdale, hoping to break the ice. According to Darrelle Revis, the coach told him, \"We need to get you up there. We need to win the Super Bowl.\" In that meeting, which lasted three hours, Johnson and Rex Ryan discussed financial parameters, including a 10-year contract. Johnson believes the fast-approaching season opener convinced Darrelle Revis to soften his stance. He also said they talked to Darrelle Revis about his legacy in football. \"We talked about the Hall of Fame, how important it is to keep it on the right track,\" said Johnson, adding, \"Hall of Fame and'Darrelle Revis' aren't a strange pair.\" All parties said they left the meeting with a renewed sense of optimism. But early Sunday evening, the talks almost broke off. Rex Ryan blew a fuse, screaming into a speaker phone at Darrelle Revis' agents. \"It's kind of like a boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but the parents won't let you get together,\" Rex Ryan said. \"That was kind of how I felt. He wanted to play. I wanted him to play, but for some reason it wasn't happening.\" Said Jon Feinsod, one of Darrelle Revis' agents: \"Rex got a little upset with us. He told us he was going to go coach his football team and that he was sick and tired of us.\" Several players admitted they didn't think a deal would get done before the start of the season. As linebacker Bart Scott said, \"I was preparing myself to go to the game without him.\" Added Bart Scott, \"He's a tremendous player who allows us to do a lot of things, allows us to open up our playbook a little bit.\" Darrelle Revis came off his demand to be the league's highest-paid cornerback. Before training camp, he was adamant about receiving $16 million per year, topping the Raiders' Nnamdi Asomugha ($15.1 million average). The Jets weren't going to go that high, but they satisfied Darrelle Revis with $32 million in guarantees. Darrelle Revis said he's in great shape, but he admitted he's not in football shape. Nevertheless, he expects to play the entire game against Ravens. He already has been studying tape of wide receiver Anquan Boldin. \"He makes our job a lot easier,\" Rex Ryan said. \"Mike Pettine and I, we're better coaches now. Dennis Thurman is a better coach today than he was yesterday. He allows us to do things on defense that we probably couldn't do if he wasn't with us.\" Now the Jets get back to football after what Darrelle Revis described as an eye-opening experience. He was surprised to see \"how nasty it can get.\" A big contract can ease the nasty. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com.

Mike Tomlin said he picked Dixon over longtime backup Charlie Batch because of Dixon's strong performance in the preseason. Ben Roethlisberger is serving his four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy, while Byron Leftwich is out indefinitely with a sprained left knee ligament. \"It's an honor, obviously. The ultimate for a quarterback is to be the starter,\" Dixon said Monday. \"It's every quarterback's dream to be a starter in the National Football League. My number is called now, and I'm going to have fun with it. I'm happy, but there's a lot of work to be done.\" Leftwich, reacquired by Steelers during an April trade, was expected to start while Ben Roethlisberger was out, but sprained his left medial collateral ligament Thursday against Panthers. Dixon, a third-year player from Oregon, threw for a touchdown and ran for another during an overtime loss in Ravens last season when Ben Roethlisberger was out with a concussion. Dixon took snaps with the starters during the Steelers' first practice of the week Monday. Dixon is an excellent runner and has a good throwing arm, but Batch is much more experienced and has an intimate knowledge of the playbook. \"Dennis has had a very productive preseason and training camp,\" Mike Tomlin said. \"He went into the training camp as a young guy, second in the pecking order behind Byron Leftwich. He did a nice job and made it extremely competitive. He waged a battle and got some first-team reps in some preseason games. Largely, we've been very impressed with how he's handled himself in game situations.\" Dixon got much of the work with the starters Aug. 29 in Broncos, hurting his chances of beating out Leftwich by throwing two interceptions during a 34-17 loss. Batch has played with Steelers since 2002, but has thrown only two passes since 2007 while getting injured each of the past two seasons. He was the number 4 QB during training camp, and his lack of time with the starters during camp and in the exhibition games hurt his chances of starting. \"There was a specific pecking order in camp, and Charlie's durability or lack of durability added into it,\" Mike Tomlin said. \"This is a guy who's been on IR [injured reserve] a little bit the past couple years, but he also requires very few snaps to be prepared to play football at an acceptable level.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5539943", "Entities": ["Steelers", "Falcons", "Mike Tomlin", "Ben Roethlisberger", "Panthers", "Ravens", "Broncos"]}, {"title": "Seahawks shuffle roster before opener", "author": null, "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "RENTON, Wash. -- The leading receiver from a year ago is gone, the leading rusher was rumored to be heading out only to be at practice, and a half-dozen new players made introductions on Monday at Seahawks headquarters. According to Pete Carroll and John Schneider, the massive roster shakeup just a week before the start of the regular season was all part of their plan when they approached building and reconstructing the Seahawks roster. \"The most exciting part of it is if you have a coach and a coaching staff that is willing to move forward and teach and put in the extra time to get new players ready, it can be an extremely exciting period to add players,\" Schneider, the Seahawks general manager said on Monday. \"This is not something we're trying to patch. We're trying to build. It's not like a rebuilding thing, it's not like a patching thing. It's a continuously building this thing as we go.\" The 53-man roster on the field Monday afternoon was far different than the team that returned from Raiders last Thursday night following the final preseason game. Gone was T.J. Houshmandzadeh, the Seahawks leading receiver from last year and who will make more than $6 million from Seahawks in 2010 despite now being a member of the Ravens as part of his guaranteed contract. Houshmandzadeh was cut in order to give younger receivers Golden Tate, Deon Butler and Ben Obomanu more opportunities, along with the emergence of former first-round pick Mike Williams, Schneider said. Also gone was versatile safety Jordan Babineaux, starting fullback Owen Schmitt, offensive lineman Mansfield Wrotto and number 3 quarterback J.P. Losman. Those players were sent packing over the weekend after Seahawks traded away starting cornerback Josh Wilson last week. Oh, and offensive line coach Alex Gibbs suddenly retired on Friday. He was replaced by Pat Ruel, who was coaching with Omaha in the United Football League until getting a call from Pete Carroll on Friday night. Ruel worked with Pete Carroll at Southern California. \"It was probably more'hellos.' Came here today and there were a bunch of guys we didn't know,\" Mike Williams said. \"But it was like that when we got here in the spring so we'll get the guys that just got here and get them in here as fast as we can and learning what we do and how we do it.\" Still around was running back Julius Jones, rumored to be cut over the weekend (including a Tweet from ESPN's Adam Schefter), only to be at practice on Monday and undeterred by the talk of losing his job in Seahawks. Schneider said he made it a point to apologize to Jones after the reports surfaced. \"It was false. You can't always believe what you read or see on TV,\" Jones said. \"I've been in contact with everybody. My weekend went business as usual, just like practice went business as usual today. Everything you guys heard was false. I got a lot of phone calls, a lot of text messages but I'm still here.\" But even though Jones is sticking around, he's being demoted for now after being Seahawks's leading rusher each of the last two seasons. Pete Carroll said after Monday's practice that Justin Forsett will get the start on Sunday. Schneider and his scouting staff approached the cutdown day in a similar regard to the NFL draft. Schneider had an ever evolving board with all the players Seahawks wanted to target. When a players they wanted became available, the Seahawks recruited aggressively. The result: the addition of offensive linemen Stacy Andrews and Evan Dietrich-Smith; defensive linemen Raheem Brock and Junior Siavii; cornerback Mike Ness and fullback/special teams standout Michael Robinson. \"I didn't think I'd be coming back here,\" said Brock who was in Seahawks with Titans to open the preseason. \"But anything happens in this league. I'm happy to be here and it seems like it's going to be fun.\" Now comes the task of inserting the new pieces with what remains and coming up with a game plan for Sunday's opener against 49ers. Pete Carroll confirmed Monday that injured left tackle Russell Okung won't play as he continues to recover from a high right ankle sprain. It's likely either Chester Pitts, coming off microfracture knee surgery, or recently acquired Tyler Polumbus will start. Pete Carroll also noted that most of the new additions are support players for now and not front line starters. \"This doesn't have anything to do with the game plan though, as far as I'm concerned,\" Pete Carroll said of the moves. \"We've been working on this game plan for months. We're all over it, so it doesn't affect it.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5540904", "Entities": ["Seahawks", "Pete Carroll", "Raiders", "Ravens", "Golden Tate", "Deon Butler", "Mike Williams", "Jordan Babineaux", "Josh Wilson", "Stacy Andrews", "Evan Dietrich-Smith", "Titans", "49ers", "Russell Okung", "Tyler Polumbus"]}, {"title": "Giants: 5 things to watch for 2010", "author": "Ohm Youngmisuk", "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "Tom Coughlin wants the Giants to get back to running the ball. After snapping a seven-year streak by failing to post a 1,000-yard rusher last season, the Giants will start Ahmad Bradshaw, with Brandon Jacobs cast as the change-of-pace back. The two are coming off surgeries in the offseason and are healthy. The Giants' offensive line is determined to return to its dominant form from two seasons ago and provide Eli Peyton Eli Manning with a running game again. The Giants have several players coming back from injuries. Perhaps none is more important than safety Kenny Phillips. Kenny Phillips was emerging as a star before needing season-ending microfracture knee surgery after just two games last year. Now the safety is back and determined to prove that he can not only start again but be better playing alongside Antrel Rolle. The Giants have a lot of question marks on defense, but the biggest is at middle linebacker, where Jonathan Goff will start. The third-year linebacker impressed many in the preseason finale against the Patriots. Now he has to call the plays to stop Panthers's power running game before facing Peyton Eli Manning in Week 2. Antonio Pierce's departure not only left the Giants with a gaping hole at middle linebacker but it created a leadership void. The captain was the heart and soul of the defense. Now the Giants hope Justin Tuck, who likes to lead more by example, will step up and show some Pierce and Michael Strahan -type leadership skills. The Giants' special teams have been a major concern for Tom Coughlin throughout the preseason. The Giants lost punter Jeff Feagles to retirement and returner Domenik Hixon to a season-ending knee injury. Now rookie punter Matt Dodge, who replaces a legend, and recently acquired returner Darius Reynaud, who came in the Sage Rosenfels deal with Vikings, need to step up.

Agents Jonathan Feinsod and Neil Schwartz and the unnamed team agreed to terms on a contract Saturday after the team was given permission by Chargers to talk to Vincent Jackson. Talks ended after the Chargers and the unnamed team reached an impasse over trade compensation. The exact compensation package Chargers is seeking is unknown, but the team does believe Vincent Jackson is a valuable player, so it's no surprise they want a lot in return for him. \"We had a one-year deal done and the team could not agree on draft choice compensation with the Chargers. Those are the facts,\" Feinsod told ESPN.com. Asked if he thinks a trade can still get done with that team, Feinsod said: \"You'd have to ask the Chargers that.\" Schwartz told the Chargers Union-Tribune that \"we have no idea\" what the Chargers requested in return for trading Vincent Jackson. Chargers's trade demands could decrease as Vincent Jackson's holdout continues or the Chargers' could let him sit out the season. Vincent Jackson has said he is prepared to sit out the entire season. Vincent Jackson held out all of training camp and the preseason, seeking a five-year contract worth $50 million, with $30 million guaranteed, sources told ESPN.com senior writer John Clayton. Chargers is balking at giving him a new deal. Vincent Jackson was deemed a restricted free agent due to the lack of a collective bargaining agreement in 2011. If he doesn't play in the final six games of the year, Vincent Jackson will not accrue a year toward free agency. In that case, if there is no lockout in 2011, he'll still be a restricted free agent when the 2010 season ends. Vincent Jackson faces a three-game suspension from the NFL after two drunken driving arrests and then must sit three more games because Chargers placed him on the roster exempt list. If he is traded, the NFL Players' Association will probably try to get Vincent Jackson off the exempt list and get him on the field after his NFL suspension is served. In August, Chargers gave Seahawks permission to talk to Vincent Jackson, but the Seahawks could not come to an agreement with the receiver. Bill Williamson covers the AFC West for ESPN.com.

Preparing Darrelle Revis Island: Darrelle Revis is back after a five-week holdout and, barring an injury in practice, will be in the starting lineup for the season opener. Even though he stayed in shape while he was away, Darrelle Revis will need three or four weeks before he's sharp. Basically, the first four games will be his training camp. Still, Darrelle Revis at 90 percent is better than most. 2. Grounding and pounding: The Jets changed two vital elements in their league-leading running attack.They have a new back to complement Shonn Greene. Say hello to LaDainian Tomlinson. LaDainian Tomlinson looked fantastic in the preseason, but, at 31, can he maintain it for 16 games? They also have a new left guard, Matt Slauson, who is struggling. Matt Slauson is a liability in pass protection. It could get him benched in favor of rookie Vladimir Ducasse. 3. The new Calvin Pace-setter: With outside linebacker Calvin Pace (broken foot) expected to miss at least one or two games, Jason Taylor becomes an every-down player at 36. He still might have enough in the tank to pressure the quarterback, but he doesn't play the run as well as Calvin Pace. The Jets signed Taylor to bolster the fourth-quarter pass rush. That'll be a neat trick if he plays every down. 4. Feeding the hungry: Wide receivers Braylon Edwards and Santonio Holmes are in contract years, and they'll be looking for big stats to take to the bargaining table. That will be tough with a young quarterback and two other weapons, Jerricho Cotchery and Dustin Keller. Is it possible to keep everybody happy? 5. Not up to speed: The Jets have a terrific defense, but there are two shortcomings, according to opposing scouts -- depth and speed in the front seven. With a pair of 30-plus outside'backers, Taylor and Bryan Thomas, and a 30-plus defensive end, Shaun Ellis, the defense could have problems against teams that like to run on the perimeter. It also could be exposed in pass coverage. 6. Survive until Halloween: The first six games include Ravens, Patriots, Dolphins, Vikings and Broncos -- rough. A 3-3 start wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. Also, the offense won't have Santonio Holmes for the first four games because of a suspension. 7. Nick Folk hero: Former Cowboys kicker Nick Folk, trying to rebound from a disastrous season, enjoyed a solid preseason. If he can regain his Pro Bowl form, it would be huge because the Jets figure to play a bunch of close games that could be decided by a field goal. 8. Calling all leaders: After unloading Bryan Thomas Jones, Alan Faneca and Leon Redskins, there's a leadership void on offense. Given that, cutting revered fullback Tony Richardson on Sunday probably wasn't the smartest move -- although the team did re-sign him one day later. 9. Bull's-eye on the back: In case you haven't heard, Rex Ryan has done a lot of chirping. He's been predicting big things and ticking off everybody in the league not affiliated with the Jets. They will get everybody's best shot week after week, which will make the road to the Super Bowl tougher than it needed to be. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

The shaky way the team finished the preseason, coupled with some of the moves made at Saturday's roster cutdown, has seemingly shaken the confidence of many e-mailers. There is a lot to digest, from the final makeup of the roster to defensive concerns to the season opener against the Bengals. Let's get right to it. Q: Please assess the Pats defense. Will they be able to get off the field? -- Larry (Sharon, Mass.) A: Larry, I see question marks against the run in the pure fundamental aspect of shedding blocks and tackling. That's something that has generally been good in Bill Belichick's tenure, but if they don't get it squared away, it will be a challenging 2002-like year. I think the secondary will be fine, and the players up front will be able to generate enough of a pass rush to get off the field in some key situations, with Tully Banta-Cain and Mike Wright the top rushers. The top defense didn't look good in the final two preseason games, but part of that is the lack of scheme/adjustments. That's what makes the preseason hard to judge. Overall, I don't think it's a dominating defense, and there are personnel questions at defensive end and outside linebacker, but I think the Patriots can complement the defense with strong offense and special teams performance to field a team with a winning record. Q: Hi Mike, I don't think the Patriots D will be able to stop anyone this year and certainly getting off the field on third down will continue to a problem. Several players will have to emerge and I do not see anyone as a clear favorite to do this. On top of this, Mayo does not look right. I see an 8-8 record this year. The only upside I see right now is they might be more effective in the red zone on offense with their tight ends. Are you still sticking with 11-5? -- Watson (Canton, Ohio) A: Watson, I still think this is a 10-win team. Given the Patriots' run of injuries in the preseason and some defensive concerns, I dropped my prediction from 11-5 to 10-6. That prediction was part of a larger piece in which 10 different Patriots predictions were made this season. As for Mayo, I think he's going to be fine. Part of his struggles against the Giants in the preseason finale was breakdowns with Derrick Burgess on the left defensive edge, which forced him into tougher-than-they-should-be situations. Q: Mike, is it time to stow away any hopes of a Super Bowl run in 2010? -- Nick (Wisconsin Rapids, Wisc.) A: Nick, I wouldn't count the Patriots out just yet. As we know, a lot of things change over the course of the year. At this time last year, how many people were counting the Saints in? The Patriots obviously have a lot of questions to answer, but they aren't alone. Q: Any idea why Randy Moss is taking it personal that he wasn't given a contract before heading into the last year of his current deal? Has he not read the papers? Tom Brady is in a similar spot, and his deal should be done before Randy's. Is this more of a calculated move by Moss to get the team talking about an extension for him, or is this him merely venting? -- Rick (Pelham, N.H.) A: Rick, my sense of it is that Moss is sensitive and he is basically just asking for a little bit of a love -- not necessarily in the form of a contract but maybe a verbal hug of sorts. I think quarterback Tom Brady might have picked up on it, as the two were spotted at dinner together on Monday night. I think Tom Brady was being the leader he is and sensing that maybe Moss needed a little pick-me-up. When a team signs on with Randy, it is basically signing up to hold on for an unpredictable ride and I'd put his recent comments about his contract in that category. Moss has been paid as one of the top receivers in the game from 2008 to this year. For many, that would be enough to feel wanted. Q: Mike, people are being very critical of the Patriots and their past drafts, and are now saying their last two drafts were \"bad\" because they cut developmental offensive line guys like Ted Larsen, Rich Ohrnberger, George Bussey and Thomas Welch. But in criticizing the drafts, people fail to mention all the guys that are making contributions. Why so much hate for the Pats? -- Arjuna (Derry, N.H.) A: Arjuna, my take is that we could look at any team and identify some draft picks that didn't pan out. That's par for the course. Specific to the Patriots, I think they've generally drafted well under Bill Belichick when compared to the rest of the NFL. They have had a bad run here on the offensive line, but I don't view it as catastrophic as guard/center Ohrnberger has returned on the practice squad and tackle Steve Maneri was claimed on waivers, so he's essentially another draft pick. We could also look at former rookie free agent Ryan Wendell as another draft pick as he was developed in the system and made the team over other highly touted players. Q: Mike, after the roster cuts I am really worried about the depth and talent of the defensive line, outside linebackers, the offensive line, and even special teams. This might be the worst depth and talent at these positions since Bill's first year here. I think it shows just how badly they have drafted since their last Super Bowl victory. Unless Tom Brady has a year like 2007, I don't see how they will have a better record than last year, let alone make the playoffs. What are your thoughts? -- Josh (Dighton, Mass.) A: Josh, I concur with the concerns about depth, although I think it's more about contract holdouts/injuries than drafting. The Patriots are down five players in Logan Mankins, Nick Kaczur, Leigh Bodden, Ty Warren and Brandon McGowan and the season hasn't even started yet. Those are all players who would be on the 45-man game-day roster. That's a lot to lose this early in the season. I thought it was telling that the Patriots were trading for other teams' fringe players at the roster cutdown. Usually, it's the other way around and I wrote about that over the weekend. So it doesn't look great in the depth department right now, but I wouldn't count this team out. There is still quality talent in that locker room. Q: Do you think the Pats management team -- specifically Bill Belichick -- is losing it? If you didn't know the Pats history you would think they were in the lower tier of the NFL the last couple of years: Poor drafting, being stubborn about signing Logan Mankins, lack of a pass-rushing defensive lineman, a porous defensive backfield, cutting players with experience, picking up other team's cast-offs. It doesn't sound like a winning team to me. If they finish 8-8 this year they will be lucky! -- Paul Gigliotti (Andover, Mass.) A: Paul, I don't think Bill Belichick is losing it. I also think it's important to look at the context of the entire NFL when it comes to the draft, and the Patriots still rate highly when that comparison is made to other teams. One question I would ask on this topic, however, is whether there are any dissenting voices when it comes to Bill Belichick's personnel decisions. I'd use Derrick Burgess as an example. That was a bad miscalculation that could hurt the team this year. Going back to acquiring him for third- and fifth-round draft picks and then re-signing him this year, I just wonder if anyone internally said to Bill Belichick, \"Bill, are you sure about this guy? Should we really be this accommodating to a player who hasn't shown up for camp and is making a tough transition in the system from defensive end to outside linebacker? Can we really count on this guy?\" Bill Belichick obviously has the final say, but it can be healthy to have some dissenting voices in the room. Q: Do you think Jarvis Green could help the Pats? Also, would you agree that the Pats are going to have to sign Tom Brady, Logan Mankins and Moss to show players around the league the Pats are still the leaders in the NFL. -- Nick (Hull, Mass.) A: Nick, I don't see the Patriots signing Green at this time. They have seven defensive linemen on the roster and that's a fully stocked group. If there is an injury, I could see them reaching out to Green as a possible in-season signing. On the second part of the question, I think all three are high-caliber players, but Tom Brady is the only one who stands out as a guy you can't lose and expect other free agents to still consider Patriots a destination. That's no disrespect to Logan Mankins and Moss, but I think there are a select few players in the NFL that impact the decision-making of free agents and Tom Brady is one of them. Q: Mike, people are nervous losing Leigh Bodden. My concern is losing Brandon McGowan. I know Brandon Meriweather has to potential to be top 5 in the league and Patrick Chung shows a lot of promise but McGowan last year helped the Pats out big time. -- Jada (Boston, Mass.) A: Jada, I was surprised when looking back at the playtime numbers and realizing that McGowan played 72 percent of the snaps last year, the fourth-highest total of any defender. I expected that number to drop this year with Patrick Chung emerging, but it is a reminder of the important role McGowan played. I thought McGowan was strong early last season and then tailed off a bit late. He is a physical player and I think the Patriots will miss the edge he brought to the back end and on special teams. But I do think newcomer Jarrad Page will be capable of filling the void once he gets up to speed in the system. Q: Hey Mike, Rob Ninkovich is one of only a few defensive players who really impressed me during the preseason. He flies in hard off the edge, and seems to be one of those football players who frequently ends up around the football. Do you think he has a chance of starting at the OLB position opposite Tully Banta-Cain? Jermaine Cunningham hasn't played and I like him better than Marques Murrell. -- Zack (Somerville, Mass.) A: Zack, I like Rob Ninkovich's quickness and motor. The question to me is whether he can set the edge against the run consistently. I'd give him a chance to show what he can do, and hope that Jermaine Cunningham gets healthy and can also contribute. I agree at this point; Rob Ninkovich would be my choice to start the opener. Q: Mike, were you surprised by Tyrone McKenzie being cut and then brought back on the practice squad? Bill Belichick has professed admiration for this player numerous times in the past. He essentially only had OTAs and the preseason to show what he could do. He is coming back from an ACL injury, which as we learned with Tom Brady last year, might prevent a player from going 100 percent even after he is participating fully on the field. He was a high draft investment, and a hard worker. He seemed like a follower of the Patriot Way. -- Dave B (49ers) A: Dave, I was not surprised by the McKenzie move. I saw some writing on the wall from the first Sunday in camp when 2009 starter Gary Guyton was knocked out with an injury and it was Brandon Spikes, not McKenzie, who was inserted at inside linebacker. In making our first 53-man roster projection, I did not have McKenzie on the roster because of that. Also, McKenzie's playing time was limited for a good part of the preseason and he was not a special teams contributor with top units, which were other troubling signs for him. The Patriots are interested in still working with McKenzie, as my understanding is that they are paying him more than the standard practice squad rate to keep him, so he could still emerge. But right now, he's been passed by Brandon Spikes, Gary Guyton and rookie free agent Dane Fletcher. Q: You wrote that there would be 10 starters or key contributors from the last two drafts. On offense, I see Vollmer and the rookie TE. On defense that would be Brandon Spikes, Patrick Chung, Darius Butler and Devin McCourty. That's six by my count. You are a homer. -- Jim Cotter (Providence, R.I.) A: Tough crowd, Jim, and one that overlooks special teams as well. Let's go back and look at what I wrote : \"The Patriots made 24 draft picks over the past two years, and backup quarterback Brian Hoyer -- who made the club as a rookie free agent last season -- is a 25th player. Of that group, 14 to 16 look like locks to make the team, with about 10 of them in starting or top roles.\" As it turned out, 16 made the club and I count 11 players in starting or top roles: Patrick Chung, Butler, Vollmer, Tate, Ingram, Edelman, Devin McCourty, Gronkowski, Brandon Spikes, Aaron Hernandez and Mesko. We could probably even add Jermaine Cunningham in there for a 12th, but I was conservative in that analysis. Q: Mike, how much does the fact that veteran contracts are guaranteed if a player is on the week one roster play into the Patriots cut-down decisions? Do you see Pierre Woods as playing a potential role after week one but the Pats not wanting to guarantee the contract? Or will they only be coming back in response to injury? -- Ted (Boston) A: Ted, I'd put it in the latter category. I could see Woods back in the event of injuries, but I don't see his situation as one in which the team cut him so it didn't have to guarantee his salary. I'm sure there are something situations where that becomes a factor with cuts, but I don't see it in play with this one. Q: I realize this is pretty deep down the roster, but why cut core special teams guys like Aiken/Woods and then trade for another special teams guy ( Tracy White) the same day. White doesn't seem to have the size to hold up in a 3-4 while Woods/Aiken were at least capable of playing back up roles. -- Earl (Waltham, Mass.) A: Earl, on the surface, that was a head-scratcher to me as well. Looking closer into it, the Patriots view White as one of the NFL's better special teams players, someone who will add an element of speed that Aiken and Woods do not have. I think that was their primary thinking behind making the move and giving up 2012 draft considerations to do so. It's a curious decision on the surface, to give something up for a nine-year veteran who is joining his fifth team, especially since the Eagles had announced he was released earlier in the day. Q: Mike, can we put to bed the notion that the Patriots are going to \"go back to their old Super Bowl ways\" of game and clock management and pounding the ball to victories? If Bill Belichick had any plans of doing that, he would have brought in some running backs in the offseason or during the draft. I can't believe people are getting excited over Fred Taylor as the starting back these days. The Patriots went into last sesaon with the same exact running backs and what happened? Morris and Taylor got injured, because thats what they do, and Laurence Maroney was inconsistent, because thats what he does. And it is what they will continue to do this season. The Patriots are going to do what they have done since 2006 when they decided that the running game was not worth their time. This means they are going to pass, pass, pass and hope this makes up for their young and inexperienced defense. -- Matt (Andover, Mass.) A: Matt, it's a fair point, and is something that is addressed in \"Bruschi's Breakdown\" this week when the makeup of the 2010 Patriots is dissected. Bruschi agrees with you and explains why, basically saying that Tom Brady, Randy Moss and Wes Welker are the team's best players, so the idea is to get them the ball. I think the Patriots need to balance it out a bit more and develop an attitude as a good situational running team. I've seen some steps in that direction this preseason. Now let's see if it shows up in the regular season. Q: I am wondering why the Patriots are not being aggressive on the free-agent market. Are they still committed to winning? -- William Crowe (Tolleson, Ari.) A: William, I thought the Patriots have been one of the more aggressive teams in the NFL this year in free agency, signing many of their own players to big deals, such as Vince Wilfork, Leigh Bodden and Tully Banta-Cain. Bill Belichick previously said that the team felt the best free agents were their own and that's why the club took that approach. One other thought I'd add is that free agency isn't always the cure-all that it's made out to be. The Redskins and Albert Haynesworth is one good example of that. Q: Mike, you recently made a prediction for the 2010 season that Brandon Spikes should be in the running for Defensive Rookie of the Year. I've been excited about this guy since the beginning of the'09 season at Florida, and was thrilled the Pats picked him up. I also agree, it's easy to notice his keen \"instincts\" as well as Bill Belichick's praise of it. However, it seems that he struggled during the preseason with any play that extended outside the tackles, routinely a step or two behind. My question is, based on your projection, is an ILB like Brandon Spikes mostly graded on what he's able to cover/blitz inside? If not, have you seen something different from Brandon Spikes when the ball goes outside the tackles? -- DavidC (Phoenix) A: David, there have been a few plays where Brandon Spikes looked a step behind. When I wrote that Brandon Spikes would be in the discussion for defensive rookie of the year, my thinking was based on tackle statistics. I think he'll ring them up, playing in the middle of the defense. Q: Mike, how do you think Butler & Devin McCourty match up with T.O. and Ochocinco? -- Juan (49ers) A: Juan, I think the big thing for those guys is to protect against the big play. I would expect them to have safety help over the top for a good part of the game. Overall, I think Devin McCourty and Butler will fare well this season. Q: Hi,Mike, with the loss of cornerback Leigh Bodden the Patriots have the youngest defensive backfield in the NFL. How do you think they are going to do through out the regular season? -- Ritul (Malden, Mass.) A: I still like the defensive backfield. That's a lot of highly touted talent in 2007 first-round pick Brandon Meriweather (24th overall), 2009 second-round pick Patrick Chung (34th overall), 2009 second-round pick Darius Butler (41st overall) and 2010 first-round pick Devin McCourty (27th overall). They'll need some help from the pass rush, but I expect good things from that group. Q: Who do you think would be a more productive fantasy tight end, Aaron Hernandez or Gronkowski? -- Sakeef (Va.) A: I'd go with Gronkowski because I think he will be a primary target in the red zone. Q: No more Derrick Burgess, the man who I had penciled in as an opening day starter at outside linebacker. It's not that I disagree with the decision (he did not look strong in the pre-season) but it surprises me given their lack of depth at the position. Am I the only one who wouldn't be surprised to see them come out in a 4-3 against the Bengals? -- Nick (Plymouth, Mass.) A: Nick, I wouldn't be surprised if that is the case, as teams often don't tip their hands in the preseason as to their intentions. One thing I learned from talking to Tedy Bruschi is that when the Patriots played the Bengals in the past, one of the things they focused on was mixing their coverages to confuse Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer, because there was some question as to how he could handle it. Maybe a switch to the 4-3, with some wrinkles in the secondary, is the way to go. The 3-4 didn't exactly inspire confidence late in the preseason, especially in the running game. Q: Hey Mike, I was wondering where Aaron Hernandez and Jermaine Cunningham stand as far as returning for the regular season, I was hoping to see more playing time from both in the preseason. -- Mike (Eagles) A: Mike, Aaron Hernandez was back at Monday's full-pads practice so he looks like a go for the season-opener. Jermaine Cunningham, on the other hand, is still not 100 percent as he did not participate in the practice, so his status remains a question mark. Q: Mike, do players have any say when they get placed on injured reserve or is it strictly the team's decision? If I were a player losing a year to IR would be tough to swallow if I thought I could come back at some point from an injury. -- Andy (Brighton, Mass.) A: Andy, that is a team decision. While there can be some collaboration with the player, in the end, the club gets the call and sometimes that decision is made based on other roster factors. So let's use Nick Kaczur as an example. Right now, the Patriots are holding his roster spot as he remains sidelined with a back injury. But if they have a run of injuries elsewhere on the roster, they might just decide they can't wait any longer and place him on season-ending injured reserve. Q: How big of a deal is it that Darelle Revis is back with the Jets? -- Avery (Trezevant, Tenn.) A: Avery, I think it's significant from a Patriots perspective because we know how much success Revis had against Moss last year. Q: Mike, interesting to see the Pats picked up Jeron Mastrud for their practice squad after he was released by the Bucs. Does this have anything to do with the Bucs claiming Ted Larsen? Is there any etiquette to the NFL waiver process and subsequent signing of players to the practice squad? -- Neil (South Boston, Mass.) A: Neil, I would say they are unrelated moves. There is no etiquette that I am aware of, as once players are placed on waivers, they are free to be claimed by any team. The Patriots claimed Steve Maneri from the Texans, so it wasn't like they were following any type of etiquette in that regard. Q: Mike, can we expect any more trades or is the roster set? -- Andrew (Bills, N.Y.) A: Andrew, I still think things are fluid and there is a possibility for more movement on the roster. Q: Hi Mike - I was wondering if it would be possible for you to re-post (possibly with an update) the list of Pats bars from around the country? The one you posted a few months ago was nice but I can't find it now. -- Aaron (Redskins, DC) A: Aaron, here is the list. I'm not sure the specifics on Murphy's. Q: For last week's e-mailer who was looking for a place to watch the game in Portland, Oregon: As a Portland resident, I don't usually favor chains, but I have always gone to Bills Wild Wings in downtown for Pats football and am quite happy with them. They have dozens of huge screens, early opening times on Sundays, and they're amazingly happy to have you there watching TV for hours at a time. Not a huge number of Pats fans, but I'm usually pretty loud when I'm there. -- Jeremy Waterman (Portland, Ore.) A: Thanks Jeremy. I hear great things about Portland. Q: Mike, we welcoming a new NFL season means that you now have accrued a year of ESPN experience. A happy anniversary. Would you sum up a year of your experience? Is there any change in the atmosphere of the Patriots beat writer team? -- MarkJ (Japan) A: MarkJ, thanks for asking the question. Sept. 14 marks the one-year anniversary of ESPNBoston.com and it's been invigorating to be part of the site's initial growth. It looks like we'll continue to grow with some new writers/voices, with some exciting news ahead in that area. For me, probably the biggest change has been working with Tedy Bruschi. He really raises the bar and demands excellence. One of his favorite lines is \"Hey, I'm just trying to win a championship here.\" I've learned a lot from working with him, both about football and how smart he is, and we're working hard to provide some added content on the site this year in the form of a podcast. A lot of that was sparked by Tedy's desire to get more involved in podcasts. While Tedy is out on the frontlines, we also have a great group of dedicated editors behind the scenes. This is a good time to say thank you to those readers who have made the site a daily destination. And for those who haven't just yet, we'll keep working to try to make that happen.

Houshmandzadeh joins Ravens", "author": null, "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "In a surprise move, the Ravens signed former Seahawks receiver T.J. Houshmandzadeh to a one-year contract. Houshmandzadeh's deal is worth $855,000, league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Seahawks still owes Houshmandzadeh $6.15 million, meaning the receiver will make a total of $7 million this season. To make room for Houshmandzadeh, the Ravens traded receiver Mark Clayton to the Rams. A league source told ESPN that the Rams sent a sixth-round pick to Ravens and got Clayton and a seventh-round pick in return. Houshmandzadeh told USA Today that linebacker Ray Lewis recruited him to the Ravens. \"Ray said,'If you want to win, this is the place to be,''' Houshmandzadeh told the newspaper. \"The way he is on the field is how he is off the field. Passionate. Our conversation was passionate and insightful. \"I know from competing against those guys when I was in Bengals how it is in Ravens.'' Houshmandzadeh told USA Today that he chose the Ravens for a chance to win a Super Bowl. \"Ravens was about a chance to win the ring,'' Houshmandzadeh told the newspaper. \"Five or six teams have a legit shot to win a Super Bowl this year and they were one of them. Without me. \"Although I had other options and I was seriously considering those, I just couldn't pass this up. Winning is why we play sports.'' Houshmandzadeh ultimately decided to join a team in the same division as the team that drafted him -- the Bengals. Houshmandzadeh now will join a stable of wide receivers that includes Anquan Boldin, Derrick Mason and Donte' Stallworth. Stallworth, however, broke his foot in the preseason and is expected to return after the Ravens' bye week in late October. Houshmandzadeh, the Seahawks' leading receiver last season, signed a $40 million, five-year deal with Seahawks before the 2009 season. But he came to Seahawks under a different regime with Jim Mora as coach and Tim Ruskell the general manager. Both Mora and Ruskell were gone after Seahawks went 5-11 last season and replaced by new coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider. Last season, Houshmandzadeh caught 79 passes for 911 yards and three touchdowns, his fewest receptions since 2005 and his fewest touchdowns since 2002. \"He's another proven weapon for our offense -- a big receiver with good hands and toughness. The one other thing that every coach and player we talked with about him indicated is that T.J. is a driven player with an excellent work ethic,\" Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome said in a statement. Clayton, Ravens's 2005 first-round pick (22nd overall), leaves with a franchise-record nine 100-yard receiving games. \"Mark is a good person who did everything he could to help the Ravens on and off the field,\" Newsome said. \"In the end, we have to do what we think is best for the team, but letting Mark go hurts. He was first class all the way, even when we met with him about the trade. This is a tough part of the business.\" Adam Schefter is ESPN's NFL Insider. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5539093", "Entities": ["Ravens", "Seahawks", "Rams", "Ray Lewis", "Bengals", "Anquan Boldin", "Derrick Mason", "Pete Carroll"]}, {"title": "Ten predictions for the 2010 season", "author": "Mike Reiss", "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "Ten predictions for the'10 Patriots season to file away and revisit come early January: 1. The Patriots will win 10 games. Although the roster has undergone significant turnover and there are question marks on the defensive side of the ball, an explosive offense triggered by quarterback Tom Brady still makes the Patriots a tough matchup and a club that should be playing into January in the playoffs. The win total would have been higher if not for a run of injuries to key players -- offensive lineman Nick Kaczur, defensive end Ty Warren, cornerback Leigh Bodden and safety Brandon McGowan -- as well as Logan Mankins' contract standoff. That's a tough preseason in terms of losing key players. 2. Wes Welker will not lead the team in receptions for the first time since 2007. In part because he is still working his way back to form from a torn ACL, but also because the Patriots look primed to spread the ball around more, Wes Welker will not top the team's receiving charts. He should still be in the 70-catch range, however, and still will be a dangerous threat working in the slot. 3. Brandon Spikes will be in the discussion for defensive rookie of the year. The second-round draft choice, whose instincts have been praised by coach Bill Belichick, is projected to start at inside linebacker next to Jerod Mayo. His 18 tackles in the preseason ranked third on the team and his presence was also felt as a blitzer up the middle. While there are sure to be some early growing pains with Brandon Spikes, it looks like the Patriots have found themselves a sturdy young talent in the middle for years to come. 4. Logan Mankins will play for the Patriots this season. It might not happen until the 10th week but the veteran guard will ultimately report to gain credit for an accrued season. His absence has already hurt the team as replacement Nick Kaczur, transitioning from tackle to guard, is battling a significant back injury. While there are surely hard feelings on both sides, business is business and Logan Mankins' decision would be based on what's best for his future. 5. Rookie tight end Rob Gronkowski will have double-digit touchdown catches. The 6-foot-6, 265-pound target was exactly what the Patriots needed in the red zone, where they were inconsistent last season. His four touchdown catches in the preseason tied for the NFL high and his consistent presence on the field -- with no indication that his prior back injury is an issue -- has helped accelerate his development. 6. Stopping the run, not rushing the passer, will be the team's primary issue. For all the angst over the team's ability to pressure opposing quarterbacks, significant changes within the front seven of the defense will make stopping the run the bigger issue for the club, especially in the first two weeks of the season against the Bengals and Jets. The Patriots are banking on three unknowns: 1.) Can veteran Gerard Warren transition to the two-gap style of play at left end; 2.) Can Mike Wright hold up long-term at right end; 3.) Can a player who hasn't started an NFL game -- Marques Murrell, Rob Ninkovich or Jermaine Cunningham -- emerge at left outside linebacker? 7. Defensive lineman Mike Wright will win the 12th player award. While perhaps miscast as a full-time starter at right defensive end, Wright is arguably the team's best interior pass-rusher, so he figures to stay on the field on third down by moving inside and working against centers and guards. With the Patriots facing questions about their pass rush, Wright's potential impact will be crucial for the team. Wright was disruptive during the preseason, putting him in position to earn the annual honor given to the player who has exceeded expectations. 8. Stephen Gostkowski will have some early struggles adjusting to a new operation. With punter Zoltan Mesko the team's new holder on field goals, kicker Stephen Gostkowski will work to find a new comfort level. He got only four chances in game conditions during the preseason, with a 46-yarder hitting the upright and going through, another attempt missed but nullified by a Falcons penalty and then successful tries of 35 and 28 yards. 9. Tom Brady will throw for more than 30 touchdowns. The Patriots' offense has the potential to be one of the NFL's most explosive units and Tom Brady looked especially comfortable in the preseason while integrating new weapons into the mix such as tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, as well as receiver Brandon Tate. As long as the protection holds up, and it was solid in the preseason, there could be some big-time offensive fireworks. 10. Fred Taylor will be the team's leading rusher. Projected to be the first running back with the ball in his hands on opening day, the 34-year-old Taylor looks like the leader of the team's committee-type approach. While the club plans to use all its backs, and injuries could potentially alter the picture, Taylor is positioned as the runner to earn the most carries per game.

They beat Darrelle Revis and his agents. They got their star cornerback into camp a full week before their first game, and they got it done without having to yield to the outrageous demands of his representatives. For seven months, the two sides played a high-stakes game of poker. In the end, Darrelle Revis' camp folded. The Jets are no worse for the wear. This worked out so perfectly that you almost wonder whether the entire drama was scripted for \"Hard Knocks,\" which will base its final episode around Darrelle Revis' arrival and contract signing Monday at the team facility in Florham Park, N.J. Monday just happens to be the final full day of shooting for Wednesday's finale. Coincidence? Unless Darrelle Revis suffers one of those show-up-late, pull-a-hamstring injuries, the holdout and its effects won't be an issue by Week 2. In some ways, it might have helped the Jets because it afforded rookie cornerback Kyle Wilson plenty of valuable playing time in the preseason. Now, Darrelle Revis will step into his old spot, left cornerback. Antonio Cromartie will go back to his old spot, right corner. And Kyle Wilson will go back to where he was drafted to play, the slot nickel. Plus, Jets coach Rex Ryan will go back to being his old self, declaring, \"Watch out. We're back, baby!\" Oh, wait a second, Rex Ryan never admitted the Jets were gone, not even when a Darrelle Revis return appeared hopeless. Ah, but we knew better. Despite his bombast, Rex Ryan knew he'd never be able to have a truly dominant defense without his number 1 cornerback. Now he doesn't have to worry anymore. Rex Ryan can go back into his bunker with defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, cooking up exotic blitz packages that will frighten opposing quarterbacks. They would've done that without Darrelle Revis, but having number 24 -- the ultimate security blanket -- on the back end will allow them more freedom to take chances and dictate the tempo of games. The Jets usually find a way to botch these sorts of things (see Pete Kendall, 2007), but they played this holdout perfectly, agreeing to a four-year, $46 million deal. Darrelle Revis wanted $16 million per year, Nnamdi Asomugha money. No way, the Jets said. So they waited. And waited. They offered $12 million per year on a 10-year deal and $10 million per year on a four-year. The result: Nothing, except a lunch at the Roscoe Diner with Darrelle Revis' agents, Jon Feinsod and Neil Schwartz. Then on Saturday, the Jets hatched an idea. They would send Rex Ryan and owner Woody Johnson to Darrelle Revis' home in Florida, hoping to smooth-talk him into a deal. It worked, adding to Rex Ryan's credibility. Say this about him: Yeah, there's a lot of bluster, but he gets players to follow his lead. Maybe we should call him, not fullback John Conner, the Terminator. Rex Ryan put an end to this nonsense. The star cornerback held out for five weeks, incurring nearly $600,000 in fines, and he ended up pretty much where he began. Think about it: Before the holdout, Darrelle Revis was to make $21 million for the next three years, all of it guaranteed. By failing to show for camp, he voided the guarantee. His new deal includes $32 million in guarantees. (We don't know yet how much is fully guaranteed.) If Darrelle Revis had simply showed up and played out the three years left on his contract, and received an $18 million franchise tag in 2013, it would've been $39 million (all guaranteed) over four years. Obviously, the new deal offers much more short-term security because he never would've played for $1 million this season. In that respect, the contract is a win for Darrelle Revis. But who's to say he won't stage another holdout in 2012? If you're the Jets, you have to be worried about that. For now, everybody wins. Darrelle Revis gets more money this season, the Jets get their best player and \"Hard Knocks\" gets a Hollywood ending. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

All 32 teams were told in a memo from the league Tuesday that the umpire will position himself 12 yards from the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped instead of approximately 15 yards, which was used during the preseason. The umpires must now only get beyond the deepest running back -- not established in position -- before the ball can be snapped. The changes should make it easier for teams to use the no-huddle offense. That should please Peyton Manning, who expressed his frustration after an Aug. 26 loss at Packers. \"The one [illegal snap] on me I thought was ridiculous, down there by the goal line when you're snapping the ball to keep them from potentially getting a replay,\" Peyton Manning said then. \"Also, they [umpires] are unsettled. To throw a 5-yard penalty is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. So I think that's one thing that will be re-evaluated -- at least a do-over of some sort, or a warning. But a 5-yard penalty? That's ridiculous.\" The league apparently agreed. Officials will now have the discretion to issue a warning before enforcing the 5-yard penalty for an illegal snap. Clear violations, the memo said, will continue to be penalized without a warning. Umpires also will continue to be positioned in the middle of the defense, their old position, during the final two minutes of the first half, the final five minutes of the game and when the offense is at, or inside, the opponent's 5-yard line. The league made that change for last week's preseason finales. The memo also points out that the head linesman or line judge can signal when the ball can be snapped instead of having quarterbacks checking with referees, something that was changed after the league's competition committee approved the new rule in March. League officials have repeatedly cited safety concerns as the reason for moving umpires behind the deepest running back, saying statistics showed a significant increase in the number of collisions and injuries incurred by umpires. \"It reached the point where the league office thought that the physical danger out there and the safety of the umpire was becoming an issue, so we changed his position,\" Colts president Bill Polian said recently. \"We recognized that there would be, A, mechanical issues, and B, issues with respect to certain penalties that might or might not be called based upon the new position.\" But after Peyton Manning insisted changes were needed, Polian said they were solvable. Now the four-time league MVP and Polian are willing to see if this works. \"We'll see,\" Peyton Manning said last week during the annual bowling tournament he hosts to raise money for the Peyback Foundation. The league said referees and umpires will meet Friday in Cowboys to review the preseason and the mechanics of the changes to the umpire rule. The officials for Thursday night's opener will review the material during a conference call this week. Peyton Manning was not available Tuesday, the Colts' regular off-day, but is expected to comment on the changes Wednesday.

The former Heisman Trophy signed a one-year contract Tuesday. He was cut by the Cardinals on Saturday and agreed to terms with the Texans earlier this week. The 27-year-old Leinart will be the number 3 quarterback on the Texans behind Matt Schaub and Dan Orlovsky. Leinart told KRIV-TV in Texans on Monday that he's looking forward to working with Texans coach Gary Kubiak, who has a reputation for developing quarterbacks. \"I am really excited to work with Gary,\" Leinart told KRIV. \"His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with quarterbacks and what he's done with Matt [Matt Schaub] is really intriguing. Matt is a great quarterback to learn from and I'm really looking forward to it.\" The team would not disclose terms of the deal. The Texans Chronicle reported that the contract has a base salary of $630,000, with a maximum value of $1 million. Leinart's agent, Tom Condon, would not confirm the terms when reached by phone by The Associated Press. The Texans return to practice Wednesday, leading up to Sunday's season opener against Colts. Leinart complained during training camp that he had issues with Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt, and the two met late in the preseason. With Kurt Warner retired, Leinart figured he would get to start this season, but Derek Anderson won the job. The Cardinals failed in efforts to trade Leinart before cutting him. By releasing him, Cardinals doesn't have to pay him the $2.5 million he was due for the coming season. Leinart said Monday that he's eager to prove that he belongs in the NFL now that he's received a second chance with the Texans. \"I know I can play,\" Leinart told KRIV. \"I know I can have success in this league. I know I am not going to be handed anything. I've been in the same [offensive] system the last four years and now I'm excited to be a part of a new one.\" Leinart was the 10th overall pick by the Cardinals in the 2006 draft. He appeared in 12 games as a rookie under coach Dennis Green and threw 11 touchdown passes with 12 interceptions. He started the first five games in 2007 under Ken Whisenhunt before breaking his collarbone, and Warner took over. Texans had the NFL's top passing offense last season (291 yards per game) and Matt Schaub led the league with 4,770 yards passing. The depth chart behind Matt Schaub became an issue in Texans's last preseason game, when Orlovsky threw two interceptions. Third-stringer John David Booty, who succeeded Leinart as Southern Cal's starter in 2006, threw a pair of touchdown passes in the game. The Texans cut Booty on Saturday, and joined a group of teams reportedly interested in Leinart.

The Dolphins' football czar has given control of the team to general manager Jeff Ireland but will retain a role as a daily consultant. The Dolphins announced the move in a three-sentence statement Tuesday, five days before the start of the season. The change was part of a long-range plan when the Parcells regime took over at the end of the 2007 season, the statement said. \"This was the intent of the structure put in place in the past,\" the Dolphins said. Ireland will assume full control over all aspects regarding the team and support staff. Parcells joined the Dolphins in December 2007 as executive vice president of football operations, then hired Ireland two weeks later. They were also together with the Cowboys. The 69-year-old Parcells can leave Dolphins at any time and collect the balance of the $12 million due him under a four-year contract that expires after the 2011 season. He was hired by Wayne Huizenga as the Dolphins staggered to the end of a 1-15 season in 2007. In the Parcells regime's first year in 2008, Dolphins made a great leap forward to 11-6 and a playoff berth under first-year NFL coach Tony Sparano, who also came from the Cowboys. Last season the Dolphins regressed to 7-9, extending to nine years their drought without a postseason victory. During the past offseason, the team acquired Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall, hired Mike Nolan as defensive coordinator and revamped the defense. The front office has continued to be busy in recent days, acquiring six players since Saturday, and the Dolphins have 20 players with two years' experience or less. Owner Stephen Ross has said he expects the Dolphins to play in the Super Bowl this season, while most prognosticators expect a record around.500. The news that Parcells was stepping back caught linebacker Channing Crowder by surprise. \"He's just a great guy to have on your side,\" Channing Crowder said. \"But he brought a bunch of great people in, too. Tony is an amazing coach, and Jeff Ireland knows what he's doing.\" There was no comment from the secretive organization about the change in hierarchy beyond the statement. The team was off Tuesday, and Parcells rarely does interviews. \"The clock's ticking for guys like me,\" he said in 2008, shortly before his first season with Dolphins. \"You know you can't do it forever.\" Ross, who completed his purchase of the franchise from Huizenga in January 2009, didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Ireland rarely talks to the media but offered occasional glimpses into how the regime worked under Parcells. For example, Parcells was very much involved in preparations for the most recent draft, Ireland said in April. \"It's constant,\" Ireland says. \"It never stops. Bill and I have grinded through every single player two or three times.\" There have been occasional hints that Parcells had created an atmosphere allowing him to step back. One clue came when Tony Sparano spoke two weeks ago of Dan Henning, the Dolphins' third-year offensive coordinator. \"Our relationship has really grown tremendously,\" Tony Sparano said. \"Early on in the process he was a Bill guy. And now I would feel safe to say he's a Tony guy.\" Parcells worked a full schedule during training camp, arriving early, watching practices from a golf cart and often offering players feedback. Safety Yeremiah Bell laughed when asked two weeks ago about Tony Sparano's ability to recall obscure moments in games. \"He probably gets some of that from Bill,\" Yeremiah Bell said. \"Bill is like that, too. Bill remembers every play. He'll tell you about a play on Sunday you don't even remember.\" As a coach, Parcells took over losing teams with the Giants, Patriots, Jets and Cowboys and transformed them into winners. He won five division titles in 19 seasons and led the Giants to two Super Bowl championships. He quit coaching after the 2006 season with Cowboys. Ireland spent seven years in player personnel with the Cowboys, including his final three as vice president of college and pro scouting. Cowboys went 13-3 and won the NFC East in his final season there. Before that, he was an NFL scout for 11 years. Ireland has been around football since childhood, spending summers as a ball boy during training camp for the Bears. His grandfather, former Eagles player Jim Parmer, scouted for the Bears. Ireland's stepfather is E.J. Holub, a former linebacker with the Chiefs.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5543461", "Entities": ["Dolphins", "Cowboys", "Tony Sparano", "Brandon Marshall", "Channing Crowder", "Yeremiah Bell", "Giants", "Patriots", "Jets", "Bears", "Eagles", "Chiefs"]}, {"title": "Josh Freeman plans to play in opener", "author": null, "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman practiced for the first time since breaking the thumb on his throwing hand and expects to play in the Buccaneers' season opener against the Browns. The second-year pro missed the last two weeks of the preseason after banging his right thumb on the helmet of a pass rusher during an exhibition against the Chiefs on Aug. 21. The Bucs were confident all along that he would return before the start of the regular season. \"He looked great being back with this football team. He went through a whole practice,\" coach Raheem Morris said after Tuesday's workout. \"We look forward to him progressing and getting better and better, and getting back to what he was doing before he went out.\" Josh Freeman did not wear a bandage or protective splint on the thumb. \"We're going to try different things out this week. Right now, I'm going without any wraps or anything.... We talked about a glove, but I feel more comfortable with just bare hands,\" the 22-year-old said. Josh Freeman was the third quarterback selected in the 2009 draft behind Matthew Stafford and Mark Sanchez. He started nine games as a rookie, going 3-6 after the Bucs opened 0-7 with Byron Leftwich and Josh Johnson running the offense. Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Greg Olson said they are not concerned the 6-foot-6, 248-pound Josh Freeman only attempted eight passes during the preseason. The young quarterback felt fine after testing his thumb throwing the ball before last week's preseason finale at Texans. And, he didn't report any problems after his first full practice in nearly three weeks Tuesday. \"We think he's on schedule,\" Olson said. \"It's a little sore, but he felt good.\" Josh Freeman said the thumb is \"a little swollen, but nowhere near as bad as right after it first happened.\" He doesn't anticipate having difficulty handling snaps from center and insisted he doesn't fear reinjuring the hand. \"I won't be thinking about it,\" Josh Freeman said, adding that he's confident he'll be able to play with any pain associated with the thumb. \"It's just getting a feel for it and knowing my limitations.... But it's geting better. It's been improving every day.... It won't be bad. It's playing football. I'm going to get tackled. I'm going to hit the ground, probably run into a few people.\" Raheem Morris stressed that Josh Freeman took all the snaps he normally would handle as a starting quarterback, with Johnson taking the few allotted to backups. And what would it take to keep Josh Freeman from starting Sunday's opener? \"Not my thumb,\" the quarterback said. \"It would have to be something outside of that....

Ronnie Brown, Ricky DeAngelo Williams. Ricky DeAngelo Williams, Ronnie Brown. Two familiar names, two veteran backs, two key cogs in the Dolphins' offense. Yet both serve as frustrations to the other's fantasy owners. The natural instinct, for many of us, is to say that one is a natural handcuff for the other, except that's improper use of the terminology. A \"handcuff\" -- detailed excellently by colleague Eric Karabell -- is a backup running back, a player not expected to start or provide many fantasy points, behind a starter who's a clear fantasy option. The purpose of picking such a player is to protect your investment in the starter; in the event of catastrophic injury to said starter, the handcuff should slide right in and presumably provide similar production. Obviously, the first thing the handcuff hunters will say in reply is that after Ronnie Brown, who managed three games of 20-plus fantasy points the first five weeks of 2009 and averaged 13.1 for the year, was lost for the season, DeAngelo Williams stepped in with four double-digit fantasy performances and an average of 12.6 points the final seven weeks. Had you rostered both players from the start of the year, you'd have been fully protected when Ronnie Brown was lost. The problem with that argument, however, is that it diminishes DeAngelo Williams' contributions before Ronnie Brown got hurt. In those nine healthy Ronnie Brown games, for instance, DeAngelo Williams averaged 12.1 fantasy points, well within range of his level of production after Ronnie Brown went down, and the division of the rushing workload was as follows: 48.5 percent Ronnie Brown (147 carries), 34.7 percent DeAngelo Williams (105), 7.9 percent other running backs (24), 6.6 percent quarterbacks (20), 2.3 percent receivers (7). In short, Ronnie Brown and DeAngelo Williams aren't handcuffs; they're tandem backs, somewhat like DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart are tandem backs for the Panthers. But there are critical differences between the Dolphins' duo and that of the Panthers, and it helps explain why both Panthers backs are being selected, on average, earlier than either Dolphins back: Neither Dolphin is as talented as either Panther, and both Dolphins present more risk than either Panther. This is the easy one, and while DeAngelo Williams' 60.6 average draft position (58th overall), lowest of the quartet, might hint that fantasy owners are already aware how facile the argument, it's often simple for people to get carried away with facts, like this one: Ricky DeAngelo Williams had more total fantasy points in 2009 than either DeAngelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart or Ronnie Brown. I'm going to assume you're already familiar with the rationale behind not drafting strictly according to 2009 numbers and instead remind you of this: Ricky DeAngelo Williams is 33 years old and he has 2,164 career carries on his legs. You can count the number of running backs who have managed at least 800 rushing yards, eight rushing touchdowns or an average of 4.0 yards per carry (minimum 100 attempts) in a season begun after their 33rd birthdays on two hands; only nine have done it. You can also count the number of running backs who have managed at least 1,000 rushing yards or 10 rushing touchdowns in a season begun after their 33rd birthdays on one hand; exactly five have done it. Here's the full list: DeAngelo Williams' career workload is also a troubling number, as last season he became the 32nd player in NFL history to cross the 2,000-carry threshold. Of the previous 31 to do it, only nine had a greater yards-per-carry average after 2,000 than before it, and nine averaged more touchdowns per carry after 2,000 than before it. Durability also becomes an increasing concern after that point; the 31 players with 2,000-plus career carries averaged only 45 more games played apiece after getting there, and only four others remain on active NFL rosters: LaDainian Tomlinson, Fred Taylor, Thomas Jones and Clinton Portis, in addition to DeAngelo Williams. Missing the 2006 season, most of 2007 and being limited to 45 games and 575 rushing attempts combined the past five seasons might have helped DeAngelo Williams maintain fresher legs, which could explain his surprisingly productive finish to 2009. But even if that's your belief, closer examination of his 2009 game-by-game performance reveals a somewhat disturbing trend: Those splits do dismiss the fact DeAngelo Williams' most favorable matchups came in Weeks 10-12, when he faced three of the 11 worst run defenses in the NFL, but that yards-per-carry drop-off is troubling. Might it be that DeAngelo Williams was a perfect fit for a tandem role while Ronnie Brown was healthy, but when pressed into a starting role, he began to wear down more quickly? It's certainly possible. It's another obvious one: He's coming off Lisfranc surgery, a challenging operation from which to recover -- one detailed well by Stephania Bell -- and one that requires careful management all the way through the rehabilitation process. While all reports on Ronnie Brown's recovery have been positive, it's a worry that he has had two major surgeries the past three seasons -- his 2007 was cut short by ACL surgery -- and could be classified as an \"old\" 28. The Dolphins surely know this, and will undoubtedly use DeAngelo Williams to ease some of the physical strain on Ronnie Brown during his comeback campaign. That rushing-attempt breakdown quoted above is especially relevant and might even overshoot Ronnie Brown's projected 2010 usage; it wouldn't be surprising if he doesn't even exceed 40 percent of the team's total rushing attempts or 55 percent of the ones between him and DeAngelo Williams. Simply put, Ronnie Brown can't be counted on to maintain the workload of a player who, before being lost for 2009, was on pace to finish among the top 10 running backs in fantasy. A large number of fantasy owners might simply assume that such a tandem arrangement will paint one of the backs into a between-the-20s option, with the other handling goal-line work, if only because that seems a popular assumption in a committed backfield. Fortunately, that shouldn't be a worry with Ronnie Brown or DeAngelo Williams; in the nine weeks the two were on the field last year, Ronnie Brown had eight rushing scores and DeAngelo Williams six, and the Dolphins weren't afraid to toss either back out there in a goal-line situation. Heck, even if you worry that Ronnie Brown's fresh-off-surgery status might tempt the Dolphins to declare DeAngelo Williams their goal-line back, remember that in 2008 Ronnie Brown had 10 scores to DeAngelo Williams' four, and if you look at 2008-09 numbers combined, Ronnie Brown had 36 rushing attempts from within the opponent's 10-yard line to DeAngelo Williams' 32, and that was with Ronnie Brown playing nine fewer games. Both will matter in terms of touchdown potential. Ronnie Brown can also point to respectable comebacks by three other running backs who had Lisfranc surgeries within the past decade: While none of that trio should send shockwaves through the fantasy world, they at least offer hope of a full, healthy recovery by Ronnie Brown, and his top-10 potential during the weeks he was on the field a year ago demonstrates the level of his upside. He's among the riskiest selections at his position, hence the fifth-round ADP (46th, 49.5), but he's also capable of being an every-week starter in the best-case scenario. DeAngelo Williams, meanwhile, has a definitive role on this team, but at his age he's more suited to play a slight second fiddle to Ronnie Brown. Couple that with DeAngelo Williams' career workload and rapidly advancing age, and he's a flex-play capable back, but one who lacks much upside. His downside might not be quite as great as Ronnie Brown's, but he can't match Ronnie Brown in terms of upside. Maybe neither back amounts to more than flex-play status, a label typically reserved for backs who finish in the Nos. 21-30 range at their position. But based upon positive marks for Ronnie Brown during his comeback, and DeAngelo Williams' advancing age, Ronnie Brown might be a fairly attractive selection compared to his ADP, while DeAngelo Williams might be a bit of an overdraft in the sixth round. In short, both matter, but neither is free of causing his share of headaches. Tristan H. Cockcroft is a fantasy football analyst for ESPN.com.

Houshmandzadeh is embracing his change of scenery with the Ravens after officially signing his one-year, $855,000 contract Tuesday. Cut by the Seahawks' new regime led by Pete Carroll one year after signing a five-year, $40 million contract, Houshmandzadeh has gone from a rebuilding franchise to a Super Bowl contender. \"It's refreshing, man, to go from the situation I was in and come here,\" Houshmandzadeh said. \"It's hard to explain because you always want to be optimistic and I'm an optimistic person at times, but it's hard to be optimistic when you know what you're going against. I'm coming to play with guys that are similar to me emotionally, the way they play the game and how they love the game. That's where I need to be.\" The Ravens signed the 2007 Pro Bowl selection after trading wide receiver Mark Clayton to the Rams. Houshmandzadeh, 32, is intent on proving that he has a lot more football left in him after catching 79 passes last season for 911 yards and three touchdowns. And he wants to prove the Seahawks made a mistake by releasing him last weekend. Seahawks still owes him $7 million in guaranteed money for this year. \"Me not being there, I can promise you had nothing to do with football,\" Houshmandzadeh said. \"Nobody on that team beat me out. If they're honest with themselves, they know that. If you watch practice, it's obvious. For whatever reason, they did what they did. I'm not going to get to throwing rocks because I just don't want to.\" Houshmandzadeh has caught 586 career passes for 6,693 yards and 40 touchdowns. He ranks third in the NFL in receptions (451), first downs (283) and is tied for ninth in touchdowns (35) and 12th in yards (4,995) since 2005. \"You guys will see what I can do,\" Houshmandzadeh said. \"I kind of got disappointed with what happened in Seahawks for real. I know I can play. I know I can get it done. They know I can get it done. I don't really want to comment on it because it makes me really upset, but it happened.\" Houshmandzadeh expressed confidence that everyone will remain happy as far as how the workload is distributed between himself and fellow receivers Anquan Boldin and Derrick Mason. \"As long as you win, it doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Do I want the ball? Of course. And I'm sure they feel the same way. As long as you win games, it doesn't matter who gets the glory or who's getting the ball, because at the end of the day, everybody benefits when you win.

An injury epidemic at Dove Valley has left both groups in a state of flux. When the Broncos open their season Sunday at Jaguars, they could feature three players on the offensive line taking their first NFL snaps while blocking for a backfield of backups. \"Nobody is going to put the season on hold for us until we get ready to go,\" Josh McDaniels said Tuesday. \"We'll try to practice as much as we can with the group that's going to play on Sunday.\" If right tackle Ryan Harris' sprained left ankle doesn't heal fast enough, the Broncos' starting offensive line looks like it will include first-year pro Stanley Daniels, who has been cut four times, at left guard and rookies J.D. Walton at center and Zane Beadles at right tackle. \"Those are question marks to people outside the locker room but not concerns for us,\" right guard Chris Kuper insisted. \"We have confidence in everybody here.\" J.D. Walton shrugged off the notion of having too many green guys getting their first taste of the NFL all at once: \"You have to take your first snap sometime,\" he said. Even the veteran O-line starters -- Chris Kuper (ankle) and All-Pro left tackle Ryan Clady (knee) -- spent much of camp in the trainer's room. Ryan Clady returned to action last week, less than six months after blowing out his left knee. Offensive coordinator Mike McCoy insisted he won't be dialing anything back Sunday, though. \"We've got a system in place that we're going to use and a style of offense that we're going to run regardless of who's in the game,\" he said. If Knowshon Moreno isn't fully recovered from his right hamstring injury, which he injured Aug. 1, Correll Buckhalter, who carried just three times in the preseason, could get the start. Newcomer Andre Brown is down with turf toe and Lance Ball was absent from the start of practice Tuesday for undisclosed reasons. \"I've got to get past that phase where I'm hesitant,\" Knowshon Moreno said before practice. \"What I've got to do now is test it out and see how it holds up. I'm not going to be hesitant. I'm going to go for it.\" Knowshon Moreno also missed most of last year's camp with a knee injury and never seemed to find a rhythm, although Josh McDaniels has pinned the blame for his short-yardage failures on the old offensive line. Andre Brown, who was awarded to Broncos off waivers from the Giants, and tight end Dan Gronkowski, who was acquired from Lions, practiced with their new teammates for the first time Tuesday. \"I consider myself a pretty intelligent guy but it's going to take some time no matter what or no matter how smart you are,\" Gronkowski said after thumbing through the play book. Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, the team's top draft pick, practiced Tuesday for just the second time since injuring his left foot during an Aug. 7 scrimmage, but he said he's not sure when he'll be ready to play again. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Bad Moon Rising\" was one of the songs that blared over the Broncos' practice field. Trouble could very well be on the way for the Broncos' patchwork offense in the form of the Jaguars' formidable front seven on Sunday.

New teammate and fellow tailback Andre Brown went through a similar procedure last August and was back in less than a year. \"It depends on how much work you put into it and how hard you work at it,\" said Andre Brown, who was awarded to the Broncos after being released by the Giants over the weekend. \"I came back at full speed and I feel pretty fast.\" His best advice is actually quite simple -- bear down on rehab. \"You come in here and you grind it out and plug it out and good things happen,\" Andre Brown said. \"The hard work in your rehab will pay off.\" White's uncle, Herman White, confirmed the surgery to The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying the operation \"went as expected\" and that his nephew now has \"some work he needs to put in.\" \"It's going to be a long haul,\" Herman White said. LenDale White grew up in Broncos and is trying to resurrect his career with the Broncos after a fallout in Titans and a brief stop in Seahawks. He tore his Achilles' tendon during Broncos's preseason finale at Vikings last week. The 25-year-old Southern Cal standout faces months of arduous rehab as he tries to make a return to the field. Many tailbacks have struggled to come back from this type of tear, but Herman White said his nephew's spirits and confidence \"are real high.\" \"He's ready to do this,\" Herman White said. \"There are people that are speculating that he won't be back, because of the severity and that very few have been able to come back successfully. He's a young man and he's strong. I'm very confident that he's going to be back.\" Andre Brown has yet to contact LenDale White, but will give him any pointers he needs as he goes through rehab. A fourth-round pick out of North Panthers State in 2009, Andre Brown looked solid at times in Giants camp this summer before being let go. He's recently been hobbled by turf toe. \"I'm going to be good. This one is OK,\" Andre Brown said. The time it took Andre Brown to return from his torn Achilles corresponds with the research that LenDale White's family has been doing into torn Achilles tendons. Recovery is typically around a year. \"This is not something he can take lightly,\" Herman White said. \"But the healing process and returning back to form, it's something he's prepared for.\" LenDale White was brought into camp to bolster a banged-up backfield. But he sprained his ankle two days after arriving in Broncos, missing a chunk of time. He returned strong, rushing for 53 yards and two TDs in the preseason before tearing his Achilles tendon. White figured to be a force near the goal line this season for the Broncos, once he returned from his four-game suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. His uncle said he's grateful for the chance at a fresh start in his hometown. \"It's definitely a new chapter,\" Herman White said. \"It's a great opportunity for him. He's real ecstatic.\" As for what awaits LenDale White, his uncle echoed what Andre Brown already alluded to: Rehab, rehab and more rehab. \"But I'm sure the Broncos have great people over there,\" Herman White said. \"I'm sure they'll get him where needs to go.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5543028", "Entities": ["Broncos", "Andre Brown", "Giants", "Titans", "Seahawks", "Vikings", "Panthers"]}, {"title": "Top 3 Darrelle Revis reader headlines", "author": null, "date": "Sep 7, 2010", "content": "ESPNNewYork.com has launched our brand-new back-page generator -- you can check it out by clicking here -- challenging fans to write better headlines than the pros.

Wide receiver Hines Ward and tight end Heath Miller will be the offensive captains The Steelers knew for months Ben Roethlisberger would be absent when the season began, but the reality of his punishment struck them as they reported for practice this week and found his number 7 locker vacant. \"We've been anticipating this moment for some time, planning and so forth,\" Mike Tomlin said Tuesday. \"There's not any last-minute adjustment. It's just more about dealing with it.\" What they're dealing with is an awkward, unenviable situation that could force the Steelers to adopt a late-season, win-or-else mentality in September. The months of turmoil Ben Roethlisberger created with his indiscretions ultimately may be viewed in the context of what the Steelers do during their month of uncertainty without him. Should they thrive with the playmaking Dixon at quarterback and get off to a fast start, the impact of Ben Roethlisberger's missteps may be relatively minimal. However, if the Steelers flop with their number 3 quarterback in charge, Ben Roethlisberger might be remembered as the man who brought down a season before it started. \"It's very tough, kind of emotional,\" Ben Roethlisberger said before leaving the team. \"I've just got to go do what I've got to do.\" The bigger question is what the Steelers will do without him. Dixon, picked by Mike Tomlin over the more experienced Charlie Batch to start Sunday against Falcons, is fast, athletic and an exceptional runner. But the former Oregon star has started only one NFL game, and a championship-contending team almost never goes so far down its depth chart at quarterback to begin a season. Mostly because of their quarterback quandary, the Steelers -- winners of 24 games the last two seasons -- find themselves as home underdogs against Falcons. \"That's good,\" Hines Ward said. \"We're going to be underdogs all year, especially the first four games, with the uncertainty of who we have at quarterback. We play better as underdogs.\" He might be right. The 2005 Steelers, 7-5 with a month left in the season, knew they couldn't lose again if they were to win the Super Bowl, and they won eight in a row. The 2008 Steelers thrived while being challenged by perhaps the most demanding schedule ever played by a Super Bowl winner, going 12-4 before winning two playoff games and the Super Bowl. Partly to recreate the dynamics of those seasons, the Steelers scrapped their unwritten policy of not bringing back former players to reacquire Leftwich, linebacker Larry Foote, cornerback Bryant McFadden and wide receiver Antwaan Randle El. The idea was to take one or two final runs at the Super Bowl with a still-talented but aging defense. Now, this reunited group must try to keep the Steelers afloat until Ben Roethlisberger gets back. \"That's one thing about this team,\" said defensive end Aaron Smith, who returns after missing most of last season with a shoulder injury. \"We love performing for each other and being there for each other.\" To Smith, that means a defense that was the NFL's best two seasons ago must carry the Steelers through this Ben-less stretch against Falcons, Titans, Buccaneers and Ravens. The last time the Steelers faced a comparable challenge without a franchise-type quarterback was in 1976, when Terry Bradshaw was injured for much of the season and rookie Mike Kruczek filled in by going 6-0 as a starter despite not throwing a single touchdown pass. That team had a defense loaded with Hall of Famers (Jack Ham, Jack Lambert, Joe Greene, Mel Blount) and another at running back (Franco Harris) to lean on. This defense isn't as accomplished, yet it figures to be much improved with Smith and safety Troy Polamalu back. The Steelers lost five times while leading in the fourth quarter last season, largely because of their inability to defend against the deep pass. A healthy Troy Polamalu could help fix that. Running back Rashard Mendenhall ran for 1,108 yards in his first season as a starter a year ago and could take a lot of the pressure off Dixon if he gets going early. Also unsettled is the question of how Ben Roethlisberger will be viewed by the Steelers' large and passionate fan base once he returns Oct. 17 against Browns. The accusation that he sexually assaulted a Georgia college student -- he was not charged -- led to his suspension and enraged countless Steelers fans in March and April. By August, Ben Roethlisberger was greeted enthusiastically by fans during training camp, and his two exhibition home appearances attracted not one word of discernible protest. Of course, the Steelers still haven't played a game that counts. Should they go 1-3 without Ben Roethlisberger and then fail to recover once he returns, the fan reaction might not be nearly as cordial. \"If we don't win, there will be a lot of negative energy that will come out of this year,\" said Steelers fan Jeff Simpson, 34, of Clarion, Pa. \"If they can pull off even a 10-6 season, make the playoffs, I think it will all be put in the past.

What does that mean? I can't put a number of wins on it. Obviously, the goal every year is to get to the playoffs to give us a chance to get to the Super Bowl. That remains the goal. \"At the end of the year we'll take a look at everything. What I want to see is that we're headed in the right direction. There's obviously a lot of factors that go into that.\" The play of quarterback Jay Cutler will play a major role in the Bears' fortunes this season. After being acquired in a trade with the Broncos in April 2009, Jay Cutler struggled in his first season in Bears, tossing an NFL-high 26 interceptions. \"He came in last season in a tough situation; expectations were through the roof,\" Phillips said. \"It was a tough year for Jay, but everything you hear now with Mike Martz and Jay Cutler, that's real. They're on the same page. I think Mike Martz's system will only be a positive for Jay, and I look for him to come out of the gates strong and have a much better year than he had last year.\" Aside from changes on the coaching staff, the Bears also spent big money in free agency, landing defensive end Julius Peppers and running back Chester Taylor. But after an 0-4 preseason, the Bears have plenty of questions heading into their regular season opener against the Lions on Sunday. \"From my standpoint you'd like to win a couple [preseason] games because it's just the mindset of winning for the players I think is important,\" Phillips said. \"But overall I'm glad it's over, and we're 0-0. The offseason isn't just the four preseason games, it's the offseason workouts, it's the minicamps, it's the practices at training camp that were important. There were a lot of positives there.

Nice gesture, but nine months later, Wade Phillips can still feel hot primate breath on the back of his neck. \"It's a gorilla on your back if you're a head coach in the NFL,\" Wade Phillips said. \"That's the way it is.\" Wade Phillips wasn't whining, just stating a fact. That sort of pressure is permanent in his business, especially when you work for an owner like Jerry Jones, who has made it clear that he expects his Cowboys to contend for a Super Bowl title. During the news conference to announce Wade Phillips' new two-year contract, which was earned in part by ending a franchise playoff win drought that spanned five head coaches, Jones also made it clear that the deal didn't necessarily assure job security. The contract is a financial commitment, not a guarantee that Wade Phillips will remain at Valley Ranch through the 2011 season. For that to happen, the Cowboys have to win. They have to win a lot and win late in the season. That's fine with Wade Phillips, who learned the harsh reality of NFL coaching life when he lost his first job in the league, fired along with his father/boss, Bum, after three consecutive seasons of 10-plus wins with the Texans Oilers. Not that Jones is looking for reasons to get rid of a coach who has a 33-15 record in his three seasons with the Cowboys. Far from it. This might be the most comfortable Jones has been with a head coach since he grabbed the Lombardi Trophy from his old drinking buddy, Barry Switzer. \"What I do sense is our football team's confidence in Wade,\" Jones said. \"I just think that they believe not only in what he's doing technically, which would be his involvement with the defense, but what he's doing through and with that with leadership. \"The biggest thing that happened here is how these players believe in him and look up to him as their head coach. That is something that is earned over a period of time, but he's earned it. This team has his stamp all over it.\" Wade Phillips proved last season that he can produce under extreme pressure. His team won its second division title in three seasons, rallying around him in December, when the discussion about whether Wade Phillips would be fired reached a deafening roar, with the owner's weekly comments fanning the flames. His defense allowed the fewest points in the NFC, peaking at the end of the season. It was Wade Phillips' defensive mind that convinced Jones to hire him in the first place. In Jones' opinion, Wade Phillips' defensive expertise has been the biggest factor in creating credibility for the coach, at least within the franchise. Wade Phillips might never shed his image of being a puppet for Jones, not as long as he's so willing to cede the spotlight to the NFL's most hands-on owner. But Jones is adamant that such a description doesn't fit Wade Phillips. Forget public perception for a moment. Wade Phillips clearly cares little about that anyway, as evidenced by the way he kids about kissing up to Jones. Jones wants you to know that Wade Phillips is firm, passionate and persuasive behind closed doors about all matters related to football. It isn't hard to find proof. Players such as Keith Brooking and Igor Olshansky are Wade guys added in free agency. Wade Phillips lobbied hard to hire special-teams coach Joe DeCamillis. His fingerprints are all over first-round picks Mike Jenkins and Anthony Spencer, whose development played huge roles in the Cowboys defense causing Doomsday flashbacks down the stretch last season. And Wade Phillips has had a hand in some of the high-profile departures from Valley Ranch in recent years. \"If anybody thinks that he won't bite, if anybody thinks that he will go along with an idea when he thinks there's a better way to do it, they're wrong about his style,\" Jones said. \"I'm 40 feet away, as you well know, so you're going to have the perception that that's got to be a yes man, that's got to be someone that will walk on eggshells. That is not the case. That has never been the case.\" To his credit, Wade Phillips never gets distracted by anything that doesn't directly affect football. He doesn't care if outsiders consider him soft. He doesn't sweat his job security. His approach is to just coach as well as he can until he's told to turn in his whistle. \"Consistency gives you longevity, and I think Wade is consistent in his approach every day,\" Keith Brooking said. \"He never gets too high; he never gets too low. He's very steady. That's very key in this league.\" In other words, Wade Phillips is boring, but the players buy into it. His blitz packages are the only exciting thing about him. His news conferences should be considered as potential cures for insomnia. And his pregame speeches won't remind anybody of Knute Rockne, either. But boring has worked pretty well for Wade Phillips so far. Eagles's Andy Reid and Patriots's Bill Belichick are the only active head coaches with at least 50 games of experience who have better winning percentages than Wade Phillips (.600). Of course, nobody will be satisfied if these Cowboys win only 60 percent of their games. Pretty good isn't good enough for the gorilla. Tim MacMahon covers the Cowboys for ESPN Cowboys.

Based on technicalities in his four-year contract with the Jets, Darrelle Revis will be free to walk away after the 2013 season. He will be going on 29, still with prime years left, available to the highest bidder. And the Jets won't be able to stop him because, in the new deal, there's a clause that says they can't restrict him with the franchise or transition tag. This is doubly concerning for Jets fans because, as many of them know, the organization has a policy on renegotiations: It renegotiates only rookie contracts. If a player has a year or more remaining on his second or third contract and wants a raise, tough luck. You have to play out your deal. It's why they refused to give a new deal to running back Thomas Jones, who wound up being released. This policy, coupled with the structure of Darrelle Revis' contract, has fueled speculation that the team's best defensive player might not retire a Jet. It's easy to draw that conclusion, but let's provide some clarification: The organization views Darrelle Revis' contract as an adjustment to his rookie contract, not a new deal, per se. In the Jets' eyes, he's still on his first contract, leaving open the possibility of a contract extension before the deal expires. That might contradict the spirit of the \"no renegotiation\" policy, but the organization doesn't see the Darrelle Revis deal as an extension. He had three years, $21 million remaining on his rookie deal; now he has four years, $46 million. Seems like a one-year extension, right? From the Jets' perspective, they always approached it as though Darrelle Revis had four years remaining because their intention was to use the franchise tag in 2013, assuming they couldn't agree to a long-term extension. If you think they're fudging the \"rules,\" you may have a point, but remember: It's an in-house policy, so there's no one to stop them from fudging. The way Darrelle Revis' contract is structured, there's a very good chance the Jets will approach him after the 2010 season to try to re-negotiate again, especially if a new CBA is in place. They will be motivated because Darrelle Revis is due $25 million in 2011, and the Jets may try to extend the deal to spread out the money. \"I think he signed a four-year deal, so he's probably going to want another deal next year,\" quarterback Mark Sanchez said Tuesday. He was joking, but there was truth in that remark. One thing seems certain: There will be no Darrelle Revis holdouts in 2011, 2012 or 2013. If he stages another holdout, he'll be under contract through 2016. The deal includes a three-year voidable, a huge incentive to show up on time each year. If he does that, the contract voids to four years and he's free. The Jets have no intention of letting it get that far, but it could raise eyebrows in the locker room if they renegotiate Darrelle Revis' deal a second time. How would veterans like Kris Jenkins, Jerricho Cotchery and Jim Leonhard -- all beyond their rookie contracts, all deserving of raises -- feel about that? Would it be considered a double standard for Darrelle Revis? Would they receive similar \"adjustments\" to their contracts? The Jets feel every player is entitled to one big bite out of the apple. Darrelle Revis could get two. Sometimes reality bites. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

They completed a new $1.6 billion stadium, became national celebrities on \"Hard Knocks\" and did enough trash-talking (and cursing) to make an inmate blush. Yes, the attention-starved Jets succeeded in making themselves relevant, but their Super Bowl-or-bust mission won't be determined by a popularity contest. It will be decided by the development of a 23-year-old quarterback who needs to play a lot better than last season if the Jets are to have any chance of reaching their first Super Bowl in 42 years. Mark Sanchez, it's on you. The Jets gave him a couple of new toys ( LaDainian Tomlinson and Santonio Holmes), and they imported a mentor ( Mark Brunell) to help him cope with the highs and lows of the job. They believe he's ready for Phase 2 of the Mark Sanchez plan, which means more freedom. Instead of running 59 percent of the time, as they did last season, the goal is to be a 50-50 offense. Is Mark Sanchez ready for that? Based on the preseason, the answer is no. If the Jets are smart, they will continue to bring him along slowly, especially without Santonio Holmes (four-game suspension). The Jets finally have an identity on offense -- Ground and Pound -- and it would be a mistake to abandon that prematurely. \"For where the quarterback is in his career, he still needs a strong running game,\" said an NFL personnel executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"I don't think you want to put the game on his arm. I don't think that will put the team over the top. They still need the running game.\" Mark Sanchez, who threw 20 interceptions in 15 starts, wants to cut that total in half. But he can't do that by throwing more often than last season. This is a slow process, and the Jets can't let themselves get sucked into the hype surrounding the improved skill-position talent on offense. \"I've always believed that if a quarterback can play as well in Year 2 as he did in his rookie year, you've really made progress,\" said former coach Marty Schottenheimer, whose son, Brian, is the Jets' offensive coordinator. \"It might sound strange, but there's more attention in Year 2, higher expectations, and it's harder to focus.\" If the elder Schottenheimer is correct, there will be a lot of disappointed Jets fans. Another 12-20 touchdown-interception ratio isn't going to make anybody say, \"You know what? The kid got better.\" Mark Sanchez has to be careful not to fall victim to his own success. He won two road playoff games this past January, a tremendous accomplishment for a rookie, but he hasn't arrived -- yet. He still has to earn the trust of his coaches and teammates. He has to prove he can be the driver, not a passenger. In his 11 wins last season, Mark Sanchez exceeded the 200-yard mark only once, in his first game. All great quarterbacks are measured by their ability to get their team in the end zone when the game is on the line, and he's still looking for his first fourth-quarter comeback win. Mark Sanchez wants to be the leader of the offense. How do we know? He said so. You have to admire his spunk, but the best way for him to lead is to perform. Do your job and galvanize an offense that has intriguing talent. Do that, and you will be deemed a leader. Clearly, the coaching staff wants him to ascend to that status. It let Mark Sanchez wear Brian Schottenheimer's headset and call some plays in the final preseason game, a clever way of casting him in the role of an authority figure. What? You thought it was so he could learn some X's and O's? This season is all about Mark Sanchez. LaDainian Tomlinson and Santonio Holmes could have Pro Bowl years, but the Jets won't achieve their ultimate goal unless the quarterback develops to the point that he can win a few games on his own. A 2,000-yard rushing attack and the number 1 defense gets you only so far, as the Jets proved last season. \"As I grow up, the passing offense grows up and expands,\" Mark Sanchez said, accurately. The point is, he doesn't have to grow up overnight. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

Whenever one of the Giants is asked about what went wrong last season, the answer is rarely ever the same. And there never seems to be any easy explanation. Osi Umenyiora understands this better than most. As a kid, Osi Umenyiora would ask his father a basic question, such as what time he wanted him to wake up. \"He'd say,'Waking up is very important, and the early bird will always catch the worm,' and I'm like,'I'm 5 years old, give me a straight answer, please,'\" Osi Umenyiora said. \"I'll say,'Dad, I need new shoes,' and he'd say,'It's obvious you need new shoes, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'\" Osi Umenyiora said it was very annoying to hear his father speak in riddles. That's how puzzling the Giants were last year. After starting off 5-0, the Giants finished 8-8. They were a bigger mess than any dysfunctional family on reality TV. Players clashed with the defensive coordinator. Injuries decimated a proud defense. And by the end of the season, the Giants were a defenseless group with no direction and, perhaps even worse, no heart. This season, Tom Coughlin wants his team to return to its roots. In order to return to contention, the Giants must rely on their old calling card. The defense has to be nasty, physical, intimidating and most of all, dominant again. And in order to do that, the Giants' defense has to come together as a unit and play as one. All individuals must put aside personal aspirations and form a cohesive group. While speaking at the team's annual kickoff luncheon for fans, Osi Umenyiora took a page from his father to inspire his defensive teammates for the upcoming season. \"In discussing the 2010 Giants, the one thing I would say is this: Individually, the team is like stars, but the team is the sun,\" Osi Umenyiora said last week. \"While we might all shine, when the sun comes up, we all disappear.... That's the mantra this year: team first, team last, team everything. We will be physical, we will be aggressive, we will be a dominant football team.\" The fact that Osi Umenyiora is preaching this is important, considering he believes he helped set a negative tone for last year's debacle when he had problems with former defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan in the preseason and walked out of a team meeting. When he was demoted later in the season, Osi Umenyiora's pride was battered. Earlier this year, Osi Umenyiora threatened that there would be problems if he didn't regain his starting job. But he is determined to turn things around this season and do whatever the team asks of him. He is just one of several Giants determined to have a bounce-back season for a variety of reasons. While Osi Umenyiora wants to show that he is still a Pro Bowl defensive end, his competition for his old job, Mathias Kiwanuka, wants to prove he can be the starter and is worth a new contract. The other defensive end, Justin Tuck, wants to remind people how good he is when healthy. Last year's big free-agent signings, defensive tackles Chris Canty and Rocky Bernard, want to show that they are worth every penny general manager Jerry Reese spent on them now that they are healthy again. Kenny Phillips would like people to know that he is back and that the degenerative condition in his knee is not career-threatening. Corey Webster would like to remind many that he is still a top corner in the league. Safety Antrel Rolle wants to show he is worth the five-year, $37 million deal the Giants signed him to this offseason. And the linebackers -- especially middle linebacker Jonathan Goff -- want to prove that life goes on after Antonio Pierce. New defensive coordinator Perry Fewell has to take all of this motivation, mold it together and form one angry and inspired defense. \"I think this defense is very motivated,\" said linebacker Keith Bulluck, who wants to show his old team, the Titans, that he still has plenty left after undergoing ACL surgery last December. \"I think a lot of people want to prove a few things individually, and that will make for a great team defense because every individual on this team understands that nothing can be done without the team aspect. I think this defense is really ready to get out there to show what we've got.\" It won't take long for Tom Coughlin to find out what his defense has. The Giants open the new Meadowlands stadium on Sunday against the Panthers, a team that humiliated the Giants in their final game at Giants Stadium last year. The defense has to find a way to shut down Panthers's running game of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. Tom Coughlin probably loves the fact that the defense will be tested by one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL right away. Stewart rushed for 206 yards in a 41-9 thrashing of a lifeless Giants team. Then in Week 2, the Giants travel to Colts to face Peyton Manning. \"We're definitely looking forward to getting to work because from what I understand, they kind of put it on us pretty bad last year,\" Keith Bulluck said of the Panthers. \"I think this team has the makings of being one of the top defenses in the league, and it's one of those things that you have to work hard every day on and off the field.\" While there may not be one universal answer as to what went wrong last year, Osi Umenyiora says what the Giants need to do this year to win is real simple. And he's confident the sun will rise and the Giants' defense will rise again too. \"If you ever look at an EKG machine when it's hooked up to a human heart, you see it keeps going up and down and up and down; all that does is indicate that a person is alive,\" Osi Umenyiora said. \"The minute it flatlines, that means they're dead. This team is very much alive, and though last year was a down, this year we will be back up again.\" Ohm Youngmisuk covers the Giants for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

Please. \"They should do that,\" the Jets' coach said. \"Find him and go to him and go after him.\" Rex Ryan paused, turning off the sarcasm drip. \"They're not that...\" he said, stopping himself before he used \"dumb\" in reference to the Ravens. \"They're smarter than that. They're not coming after him. No way. No chance.\" Darrelle Revis' return will be one of the juiciest subplots in the Monday night season opener. He's in serious catch-up mode and has only three more practices to get ready for the Jets' most highly anticipated opener in years. Less than 24 hours after signing a four-year, $46 million contract, Darrelle Revis was on the practice field for the first time since the June minicamp. He participated in 15 to 20 defensive snaps, about 50 percent of the practice plays, proclaiming afterward that he felt fine. \"I just need to get my legs under me a little bit,\" he said. \"We're focusing on that.\" Darrelle Revis wasn't the only returnee. Fullback Tony Richardson, who re-signed Monday after being released Sunday, was in uniform and back on the field. The Jets cut him in a procedural move as they tinkered with the 53-man roster after the final cutdown. \"It really wasn't upsetting,\" Tony Richardson said. \"It's the nature of the NFL, and NFL stands for'Not For Long,' so you try not to let it get to you.\" Darrelle Revis reported about four to five pounds above his usual weight, which puts him at about 203. Rex Ryan didn't seem concerned by that, saying, \"He was all over the place. He was Darrelle. He's an amazing guy.\" But he's also a guy who missed the entire preseason, so the Ravens, with their revamped receiving corps, might be tempted to explore the Island. \"In my mind, I think they're going to attack me because I haven't played football,\" Darrelle Revis said. One of the common misconceptions about Darrelle Revis is that opponents stayed away from him last season, rarely throwing in his direction. In fact, he was one of the most targeted cornerbacks in the league. The reason is two-fold: He almost always covered the opponents' number 1 receiver and he was in single coverage a majority of the time. The Jets' opponents didn't have much success, as Darrelle Revis shut down a Murderer's Row of receivers, from Randy Moss to Andre Johnson to Steve Smith. The batting order will be similarly difficult in the first three games: Anquan Boldin of the Ravens, Moss of the Patriots and Brandon Marshall of the Dolphins. Teams could test Darrelle Revis' conditioning, making him cover some deep routes early in the game to get him winded. He said he did a lot conditioning work during his holdout, but it's difficult to simulate the backpedaling and change-of-direction demands at cornerback unless you're actually playing football. \"I think they're going to come after me,\" Darrelle Revis said of the Ravens. Linebacker Bart Scott, himself a former Raven, is down with that. \"That would be great,\" he said. \"We'll be on a short field.\" Translation: A lot of three-and-outs for the Ravens. Unlike Monday, when the team ribbed Darrelle Revis upon his return from holdout limbo, the mood was serious on the field. He spent the early part of practice with secondary coach Dennis Thurman, working on backpedaling and short sprints. Later, he rejoined his teammates for team drills. Nervous? Nah, not Darrelle Revis. But he went to bed early the night before, resting up for his long-awaited debut. Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com. Follow him on Twitter.

The Boston Herald, citing sources close to the negotiations, reported that the Patriots offered their franchise quarterback a three-year, $58 million contract that could be completed in the next 24 hours. The deal would kick in after this season. He is set to earn $6.5 million this year in the final season of his current deal. Initially, sources said that the report of an imminent deal was \"wrong\" and \"inaccurate,\" but later in the day a source said momentum for a new deal was building. Tom Brady's deal is complex and still has details to be worked out, but the signs are encouraging. Discussions between the two sides have focused on a four-year deal. The previous two contracts that Tom Brady has signed have been for four years, and the expectation is this one also will be for four. The value of Tom Brady's new contract is expected to be between $18 million and $20 million per season, which means it likely would be valued between $72 million and $80 million. Tom Brady deflected questions about a potential contract extension Wednesday morning in an interview on Boston sports radio station WEEI. \"I don't want to get into it,\" Tom Brady said. \"For me, it's the same as it's been. I'm trying to find a way to score some touchdowns against the Bengals [in Sunday's season opener]. I didn't spend five minutes yesterday thinking about my contract or future.\" Tom Brady added that it's \"pretty uncomfortable talking about a contract, because I know how coach [Bill] Belichick feels talking about it, and [owner Robert] Kraft does, and Jonathan [Kraft] does. \"It's an ordinary Wednesday,\" he said. \"We're getting ready for the Bengals.\" Tom Brady would like to finalize the deal this week, before the Patriots open the season Sunday against Bengals. This is logical. In the Patriots opener two seasons ago, then Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard rolled into Tom Brady's knee, injuring it and ending the quarterback's season. \"I think everybody on our team would [like to have a new deal in place before the season opener], every coach would. That's not the way things work,\" Tom Brady told WEEI on Wednesday morning. \"I love the Patriots, I love the organization, what Mr. Kraft has done for me and my family over the years, I'm always grateful. To play for coach Belichick, there is no coach I'd rather play for. That's how I felt, that's how I'll feel today, tomorrow, Sunday, the following week, for as long as I ever am playing, and beyond my playing years I'll be grateful for what I have here.\" One source said he thought a deal could be done this week, but it would not surprise him if it were next week. Talks were held over the weekend and intensified throughout the day Tuesday. Talks will continue and both sides are determined to get a deal done. Belichick was typically tight-lipped when asked to comment on Tom Brady's contract status Tuesday. \"I don't have anything to report on any contracts,\" he said. The Colts' Peyton Manning set the contract benchmark for quarterbacks by signing a six-year, $98 million deal in 2004. If the numbers the Herald reported are in the ballpark, Tom Brady would earn $19.3 million per season, outpacing the $16.3 million of Peyton Manning. But Peyton Manning is in the last year of his deal as well, and the Colts have vowed to make him the highest paid player in the league. Tom Brady is enjoying a solid training camp and preseason after returning from injury to pass for 4,398 yards and 28 touchdowns last season. Adam Schefter covers the NFL for ESPN NFL Insider.

Two sources close to the trust told Yahoo Sports that the organization is completing its investigation and will agree with the NCAA's finding that Reggie Bush accepted improper benefits while at USC and was ineligible during the 2005 season, according to the report. The NCAA cited USC for \"lack of institutional control\" and handed the Trojans four years' probation, a two-year bowl ban and a reduction in football scholarships. The president of the Heisman Trophy Trust, William J. Dockery, reiterated that the reports were inaccurate. \"The status of the USC/Reggie Bush matter remains unchanged. Any reports to the contrary are inaccurate,\" Dockery said. ESPN's Chris Fowler told \"SportsCenter\" that although members of the eight-person trust have had informal conversations among themselves about what to do about Reggie Bush's Heisman, \"they certainly have not made any decision\" about rescinding it. \"They haven't made a decision. No announcement is imminent,\" Fowler said Tuesday. \"They have not had any formal meetings about this.\" Dockery has said the Heisman Trophy Trust meets on the second Tuesday of every month. Reggie Bush would become the first player in the 75-year history of the Heisman Trophy to have the award taken away. \"It is what it is,\" USC coach Lane Kiffin said after the team's practice on Tuesday. \"Just like I tell our players, we worry about what we can control. We can't control what the decisions are gonna be of other people towards Reggie or his Heisman. It is a report. We've been told nothing by the Heisman Trust about them taking it back so we'll worry about it when it happens, if it does. And even if it does, we still can't control it. Our team doesn't even talk about it. We're worried about this opponent coming up and having a good week of practice.\" In July, USC president C.L. Max Nikias ordered the school's athletic department to return its copy of Reggie Bush's 2005 Heisman to the Heisman Trophy Trust. Nikias also ordered the school to remove nearly all references to Reggie Bush and former basketball player O.J. Mayo, including murals, as part of the NCAA's directive to disassociate the school from the athletes. As that time, Reggie Bush had not been asked to return his copy and the Heisman Trophy Trust said it had not yet decided whether Reggie Bush would be stripped of the award. Reggie Bush met with Heisman representatives last month at the New York law offices of Emmet, Marvin & Martin, the sources said, according to the Yahoo report. The sources declined to discuss the details of that meeting, according to the report. Reggie Bush now plays for the Super Bowl champion Saints, who said Tuesday that they would have no comment on the report. Typically, the Saints have declined comment on Reggie Bush's NCAA violations because they have no bearing on his pro career. Team headquarters also were closed to reporters on Tuesday. Reggie Bush's Los Angeles-based attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP. Last week, Texas coach Mack Brown said former Longhorns quarterback Vince Young, who finished second in the 2005 Heisman voting to Reggie Bush, should be given the award if Reggie Bush is stripped. Vince Young led the Longhorns past USC to the BCS national championship that year, after Reggie Bush was awarded the Heisman in a landslide. Tuesday, Vince Young's mother said she has no interest in her son being awarded the Heisman now, KRIV-TV in Texans reported. \"We're not interested in having no honor and no glory out of somebody else they are trying to tear down, no,\" Felicia Vince Young said, according to the report. \"I say to Reggie Bush today'You keep your head up.' \" The NCAA ruled that Reggie Bush received lavish gifts from two fledgling sports marketers hoping to sign him. The men paid for everything from hotel stays and a rent-free home where Reggie Bush's family apparently lived to a limousine and a new suit when he accepted his Heisman in New York in December 2005. In July, when USC said it would give back its copy of the 2005 trophy, the Heisman Trophy Trust said it had no timetable on a decision and would make no additional statements on the matter. \"The Trust will be considering the issues raised in the USC/Reggie Bush matter, and after reaching a decision will publish it, but due to the complex issues involved and the Trust's desire to reach an appropriate decision, no definitive timetable has been established,\" the trust said. \"Until the matter has been fully considered and a decision is reached, the Trust has no further comment.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/ncf/news/story?id=5542215", "Entities": ["Reggie Bush", "Saints", "Vince Young", "Texans"]}, {"title": "The Insider: Locked and loaded", "author": "David Fleming", "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "In August, to break the monotony of training camp, the Eagles held a night practice in front of 30,000 fans.

But the real spectacle took place on the field.

It comes after the Panthers shed numerous veterans in the offseason, then kept nine of 10 draft picks and undrafted rookie Andre Neblett.

On radio across the country, on \"SportsCenter\" and other ESPN programs, in chats, in my mailbag, on the daily Fantasy Focus 06010 podcast, on Twitter (as @MatthewBerryTMR), on our Fantasy Focus video show, via e-mail and texts from my friends and coworkers, through Facebook messages from people I used to go to college with, not to mention all the questions in person after convention stops in Steelers, New York, Bears, Los Angeles, New York again, plus countless airports, restaurants and one uncomfortable bathroom encounter. I absolutely love it. Well, except for the bathroom one. Here's a hint, kids. If I'm at a urinal, your team is the last thing on my mind. But generally speaking, folks are nice, enthusiastic and kind as they approach, tweet or e-mail me. I'm always flattered that someone respects my opinion and work enough to ask. Time and the pure volume of questions means I just can't get to all of them. But as we head into the final week of preseason, here are the most common and interesting ones I've gotten. It's the Q: So how worried are you about Maurice Thomas Jacoby Jones-Drew? TMR: Worried. Look, I remember saying earlier this preseason that there might not be a safer pick in the first round than MJD. He's never scored fewer than 10 touchdowns in a season, he averages 1,400 total yards and 14 touchdowns a year. He is a fantasy beast. But that was before something. I don't know what. Reports of knee surgery were quickly refuted but he is being held out of, well, everything until the regular season. I get the games, but not even practice? The fact that there's so much that's unknown scares the bejeezus out of me. That's right. Right next to me is a big puddle of bejeezus. I believe, based on absolutely nothing other than my gut, that the Jaguars are super-scared about something and there's something important we don't know here. Maybe he's fine. Maybe they are just being super-super-crazy cautious because they can be, and he's all they got. Maybe the fact is that his knee issues are nothing and he goes out with another 1,400-yard, 14-touchdown season. Or maybe, just maybe, the fact that he averaged 226 touches his first three years in the league and had 365 last season has caught up with him. Maybe the unconfirmed rumors of a lateral meniscus tear are true. Maybe they've learned that whatever it is can't get any worse, so they're gonna run him till he drops and if he needs surgery at some point this season, they'll deal with it then. All pure speculation, of course, but you know what I don't wanna do with my third overall pick? Speculate. I dropped him to seventh overall, just before Steven Jackson, another high-upside guy with questions marks. Q: What's going on in Chiefs? TMR: I don't know and anyone who says they do is lying. But I'll say this: Thomas Jacoby Jones is going to be used more than folks think. If you've read me for any amount of time, you know I've loved Jamaal Charles in the same way I love oxygen. And I believe that talent ultimately wins out and Jamaal Charles is the best running back on that team and among the top five in the league. But he can't do it all by himself, and Thomas Jacoby Jones is a Charlie Weis kind of guy -- and don't forget, Jamaal Charles is coming off that shoulder surgery. I say it's a 65/35 split and both should be drafted accordingly. Q (from Brandon Benson of New York at 3:20 p.m. ET) : Could you tell me some of your fantasy football sleepers that's [sic] hidden in the later rounds. I have my draft tonight. TMR: You know that whole article you just scrolled down to find my e-mail address? You'll never guess what it's about. Alternate response: TMR: Oh your draft isn't until tonight? Whew, I've got a few hours. OK, what's your number? Better yet, where's the draft? Should I come by? I'll pick up beer on the way. What do you drink? Q (from Colby in Gibbstown, N.J.) : What kind of advice do you generally give when it comes to deciding which keepers to pick? My league allows you to keep two players each season. They can be kept for up to two seasons and move up two rounds each time they are kept. I'm trying to decide between the following players and want to know which ones have the best value DeAngelo Mike DeAngelo Williams (3rd rounder), LeSean McCoy (5th rounder), Vernon Davis (15th rounder), Justin Forsett (16th rounder), Kevin Kolb (16th rounder). TMR: I get a lot of keeper questions. I discussed a lot of this in my Draft Day Manifesto, but I have a few general rules for keepers. First, what will it cost to reacquire the players I throw back? Second, what are their positions (in general, I rank WR and RB ahead of QB and TE), and third, what puts me in the best position for this year and future years? I also look at league scoring and tendencies if it's the same group year after year. In this case, I'd keep Vernon Davis and Forsett. As much as I like Mike DeAngelo Williams, I'm guessing this is your last year with him and I have him as a second-rounder now, so that's not that far off from where you're getting him, even with all the keepers. The difference between Mike DeAngelo Williams and whomever you might get in the third round isn't nearly as great as what you'll get from Vernon Davis and Forsett versus what you will get in the 15th and 16th rounds, respectively. Q (From KD in Texans) : My league gives QBs 6 points per touchdown pass. Does this change the value of the elite QBs, and, if so, where would you rank Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers? TMR: Yes, it does. It makes quarterbacks a lot more significant as to whether or not you'll win on Sunday, and I think it's imperative you get one of the top seven ( Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Eli Manning, Matt Schaub, Tom Brady, Tony Romo, Phil Rivers). I'd rank Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers at Nos. 3 and 4 overall, actually, in that sort of format, just after Chris Andre Johnson and Adrian Peterson. Q: OK, but what if I don't get one of those guys? TMR: Then go Joe Flacco. I've talked about him a lot but everything I see this preseason (trying the no-huddle, all the pass attempts, the addition of Anquan Boldin) tells me this is an offense that is poised to explode and that will pass much more in Joe's third year at the helm. I've moved Joe Flacco up right next to Rivers. He's less of a sure thing than Rivers, obviously, so that's why I don't list Joe Flacco as one of those top seven, but he's the guy who has the best chance of being elite this year, with Kevin Kolb the next. Q (from Derek Rampersaud in Portland, Ore.) : TMR, I just emailed you earlier today explaining (very extensively) my logic behind why I think I know who the leading lady was that your friend hooked up with. In the time since I emailed you, I have read your 100 Facts column. I read the hint you gave about her top grossing film coming after her Oscar nod. I did some research and realized that this eliminated my guess of Nicole Kidman, however, the other final option that I ruled out based on me guessing she wasn't in Paris when you hinted she was, was Julia Roberts. However, I found that her highest grossing film was Oceans, which was the film that immediately followed her Oscar nod. I think that is why you gave that hint... because it was the actress' very next film. Julia Roberts fits all the criteria and is so jaw-droppingly shocking that you would actually write a story about this. I am almost positive that Julia is the one. TMR: Yep, it's Julia. Q (from Jeff M. in Kingston, Mass.) After time-consuming research (I have no life) I think the actress is Charlize Theron. TMR: I meant Charlize. It's definitely her. Q (from Matt Torres in Boston) After narrowing the list down to four with Zeta-Thomas Jacoby Jones, Berry, Paltrow and Theron, I've come to the conclusion that it was Ms. Paltrow. Coming off her broken engagement to Brad Pitt, she was in a lost state of mind. TMR: Hmm. Forgot about Paltrow. You're right. Sorry. Ignore Roberts and Theron. Q (From Jarod in Topeka, Kan.): I just read your \"ten lists of 10.\" I haven't given it much thought since I read the article about your friend but when I saw the list of women it came to me as though in a vision: Jennifer Connelly. I've got to know if that's right; you just couldn't let it die and now I have to know. TMR: Don't tell the others, but actually you're right. Q: Seriously, dude. Who was she? TMR: Got this a lot with many people convinced their guess was correct. It's not my story to tell beyond what I've already told. Sorry. Q (from Bob Novak in Colorado Springs, Colo.): Love your analysis and the way you explain your rationale so even I can understand. You frequently mention that so and so isn't in the top group of whatever. Any chance you can post up what you consider the different tiers of players at each of the FFL positions? TMR: Sure. Go to my ranks by clicking here. Here's the lowest ranked player of each tier at each position: QB: Aaron Rodgers (meaning the first tier is Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers; get it?) / Tony Romo / Joe Flacco / Kevin Kolb / Eli Peyton Eli Manning / Matt Ryan. RB: Adrian Peterson / Michael Turner / Steven Jackson/ Jonathan Stewart / Arian Foster / Knowshon Moreno / LeSean McCoy / C.J. Spiller / Ahmad Bradshaw / Reggie Bush / Fred Taylor / Montario Hardesty WR: Andre Chris Andre Johnson / Greg Jennings / Wes Welker / Marques Colston / Steve Smith (NYG) / Chad Ochocinco / Hakeem Nicks / Dez Bryant / Steve Breaston / Lee Evans / Louis Murphy. TE: Jermichael Finley / Tony Gonzalez / Owen Daniels / Dustin Keller. Q (From Matt Ryan Patten in Tempe, Ariz.): Matthew, I got the first pick in my draft. I have a major dilemma here. This is a keeper league that is starting this year. It is a 5-year league so I am trying to make sure that I get the most bang for my buck. I had Aaron Rodgers on my team in a different league last year and he treated me really well. Now, I know this sounds completely crazy but I am honestly considering choosing him with my first selection over Chris Andre Johnson... I know Chris Andre Johnson is the consensus number 1 by all experts... TMR: I get a version of this a lot. Basically, I have this pick and I want to take this person, is that too early? And generally, the answer is no. Would I take Aaron Rodgers number 1 in Matt Ryan's e-mail above? No, I wouldn't. Even with a longer expected shelf life for a quarterback over a punishing position like Chris Andre Johnson's, I'd rather have someone special like Chris Andre Johnson and rely on the depth of the quarterback position to get someone in the draft. That said, dude, it's your pick. If you want Aaron Rodgers, get him. He's not coming back to you, so this is your chance. No rankings are gospel, but rather they are a guideline. And they are designed with a specific scoring system (ESPN standard leagues in my case) and they may not fit your exact league. Use the ranks as a guide, not a hard-and-fast rule. Q: How did you get your job? How do I get a job like yours? TMR: I feel like I answer this one all the time. But it's definitely one of my most frequently asked questions. As for how I got my job, it's a very long story, but my Wikipedia page sort of has it right. These articles in Sports Business Journal and in the New York Post are also close. Plus, I went through the story on my very first BS Report appearance, if you care to sift through the archives for that. As for getting your own job: Volunteer to write for an established fantasy website -- there are many good ones and they are all looking for cheap help. There is no conspiracy to keep good people out. If you have something new and good to bring to the conversation, you'll develop a following and doors will open. There's a lot of hard work, no immediate payoff and it's not easy to do, but getting started is fairly simple. Q (from Derek in Los Angeles): After the shaky preseason (0 TDs), do you still believe in Kevin Kolb? I took your advice here and got him in the 7th Round and am hoping it doesn't cost me. TMR: Got this type of inquiry about a lot of players, but especially Kevin Kolb and all the Cowboys, whom I have also been pumping strong. And yeah. I'm hanging tough. It's preseason. Generally, I will ignore preseason when established stars struggle. Teams are trying different things, and running vanilla offenses and defenses; it's not the regular season. Yes, Kevin Kolb is not established, but I believe in his talent and the talent and coaching around him. What I look for in preseason is teams taking a new direction for their offense, players emerging or establishing a new (or larger) role. Some players who have risen in my ranks based on the preseason include rookies Mike DeAngelo Williams of the Buccaneers and Jermaine Gresham of Bengals. I think Tim Hightower and Peyton Hillis will be a lot more involved in their teams' offenses than their current draft position suggests. I've discussed LaDainian Tomlinson, Jacoby Thomas Jacoby Jones, Joe Flacco, Santana Moss and Clinton Portis ad nauseam, but I would like to give a shout out to the Panthers' defense. Vanilla offenses or not, the Panthers have 18 sacks in their first three games and are holding opponents to an average of 11 points a game. Q (from Dan Boden, Pensacola, Fla.): TMR, our league has a member serving in Afghanistan who will be unable to draft during our live draft, any chance any of your intern-types would be interested in drafting via the phone for our buddy? He doesn't know I am asking you for this favor (I am the manager though). We could draft for him of course, but he came in 2nd last year and I wouldn't want any question to our choices of course. Just looking for an unbiased, halfway knowledgeable person to take his place. And how cool would it be to tell him we found someone from ESPN to draft for him? The draft is at 3 p.m. Central time, Saturday the 4th of September. TMR: I'm actually out of town that day at a family thing, and not near a computer, otherwise I'd do it. But I will get one of my fellow fantasy analysts here to do it. He's serving our country; the absolute least I can do is that. Thank him for me. And congratulate him in advance on winning. Q: You buying Arian Foster? What about C.J. Spiller? How soon do I need to draft those guys? TMR: Yeah, I'm all-in on Arian Foster but not as much on C.J. Spiller. Arian Foster has no real competition for the job, it's a great offense and he's shown success in the league (for two games at the end of last year). C.J. Spiller has a lot of competition, a terrible offensive line and has yet to prove he can do it in a game, especially when you know defensive coordinators will be targeting him. No issue with Arian Foster in the late fourth or early fifth as a low-end number 2. Wouldn't draft C.J. Spiller until the seventh and he'll be long gone in most leagues by then, I am guessing. Q (from @moconnor42 on Twitter): Would you consider a fast pass to the (Podcast) \"Man's League\" for Matt Leinart so at least he can be a starter somewhere this season? TMR: Ouch. And well done. I don't love Derek Anderson, but he'll be a lot better for that offense than Leinart would have been. I'm still low on Larry Fitzgerald and Beanie Wells, but not as much as I was. Q (from Jason Hoffman in Los Angeles) Hey Matt, I enjoyed listening to you on the Bill Simmons podcast, and can't wait for the \"9/02/10\" podcast! I had a quick question for you. You mentioned an application to do offline drafts that you could then upload the results to an ESPN fantasy league. I've searched espn.com, but haven't been able to find it. Do you happen to have a link? TMR: Got this one a lot too after I mentioned it on the BS Report. You have to sign up for a league first and then select offline draft to download it. But it's great. This way, if you are drafting in person (the best way to do it), you just download it to your computer, take it to the draft (no Internet needed) and fill it in with easy one clicks during the draft.

Q (from @stevanw on Twitter): Your columns, podcasts, videos, etc are filled with shameless plugs. Is it pressure from the bosses or is that just how you roll? TMR: You mean like that commercial for our offline draft app above? It's a little of both, honestly. Look, promotion of our fantasy offerings are part of my job, but it's also how I roll. I'm proud of all we have at ESPN. I (along with many, many other people) have worked really hard to make ESPN a great place to play and read/listen to/watch fantasy content. Fantasy sports is something I obviously care deeply about and thanks to the all the platforms that ESPN provides, I can spread the gospel. I'm on a mission from Okrent. I will not rest until every man, woman and child is playing fantasy sports, ideally for free here at ESPN. Oops. Did it again. What can I say? I put myself out there, company man and all, and answer everything I can. And I feel it pays off. My readers know me. I mean they really, really know me.

It is at least the second occasion the Redskins have had discussions regarding Haynesworth with the Titans since Mike Shanahan was named Redskins's coach in January. The Titans definitely would welcome back Haynesworth, a team source said, but maintained that the Redskins' asking price was still too high. The Redskins are believed to want at least two draft picks for Haynesworth. A Redskins spokesman said he was unaware of any trade discussions involving Haynesworth but sources say the dialogue occurred over the weekend. The Titans declined to comment, but Titans coach Jeff Fisher was asked about the team's interest Tuesday night during his weekly radio show on WGFX-FM 104.5 The Zone, and he said Haynesworth is under contract with the Redskins. \"If they're willing to look into the possibility of dealing him, of course we'll listen to them. We listen to those types of things almost every day,\" Jeff Fisher said. \"This just happens to be a big story because of the circumstances and the situation that arose with the offseason payment and then of course with all the drama associated with the offseason conditioning and the conditioning test and everything. Our focus right now is on the Raiders.\" Redskins quarterback Donovan McNabb said Tuesday on his weekly radio show on ESPN 980 that he hopes Haynesworth stays in Redskins. \"Albert is one of our brothers in the locker room... he understands,'Hey, I got to put the time and effort in,\" Donovan McNabb said. \"We can't win without him. I think he'll be here. I hope he'll be here.\" Haynesworth has been a thorn in Mike Shanahan's side since the coach took the Redskins job. Haynesworth drew Mike Shanahan's ire by staying away from the offseason program and later lobbied for a trade because he didn't want to play nose tackle in the team's new 3-4 defense. Mike Shanahan gave Haynesworth a chance to leave -- provided Haynesworth didn't stay around to accept a $21 million contract bonus on April 1. Haynesworth took the bonus. Haynesworth also skipped a mandatory minicamp and was fined. When he showed up for training camp, he was made to pass a conditioning test before he could practice. After several failed attempts and several days of idleness because of a sore knee, he finally passed the test on the 10th day of camp. Haynesworth then missed another week of training camp due to illness. Mike Shanahan gave varying explanations for Haynesworth's idleness each day. The coach initially said Haynesworth \"just was sick,\" then said the cause was dehydration, then finally said it was \"more of a headache than anything else.\" As the most highly sought free agent of 2009, Haynesworth signed a $100 million contract with the Redskins, including $41 million in guaranteed money. Haynesworth will earn a guaranteed $3.6 million in 2010 and $5.4 million in 2011. Haynesworth has collected approximately $32 million of his guaranteed money in his one-plus season with Redskins. The Titans have missed Haynesworth's presence in the middle of their line, slumping to 31 sacks without him helping collapse offensive lines. He managed only four sacks with the Redskins himself, a big dip from his 8\u00bd sacks in 2008 with Titans. And the Titans know him well, having drafted Haynesworth in the first round in 2002. They used the franchise tag to keep Haynesworth in 2008 to help keep him focused, and the deal they eventually offered in 2009 was nowhere near what he got from Redskins in the first hours of free agency. The former University of Titans lineman has 28 career sacks and six forced fumbles in his first eight NFL seasons. Chris Mortensen is ESPN's senior NFL analyst.

For this \"Breakdown,\" I'll just start with some quick thoughts on the Patriots. I think the offense has potential to be one of the best in the NFL. The defense, on the other hand, has quite a few question marks. Tedy: In my opinion, this preseason couldn't have gone any worse for the Patriots. It started off on the wrong foot with Logan Mankins not reporting to camp, and he is still AWOL. The Nick Kaczur experiment at left guard failed miserably with a severe back injury. You lose cornerback Leigh Bodden and defensive end Ty Warren (both put on injured reserve). That's three legitimate starters and then you make it four with Logan Mankins. One of the main goals in the preseason is to stay healthy and keep your team intact going into the season opener. The Patriots don't have that now. Mike: You could also add reserve safety Brandon McGowan in there as well, as he's out for the year with a torn pectoral muscle. The biggest question I have right now with the defense is not the pass rush, but its ability to stop the run. There have been a lot of changes in the front seven. One thing you can generally count on with a Bill Belichick defense is that it will be sturdy against the run, but I don't think we can say that right now. Will Gerard Warren make the transition to the team's scheme at left end? Can Mike Wright hold up at right end? Is Tully Banta-Cain strong enough against the run? Will the starter at outside linebacker on the other side hold up against the run? Tedy: In the preseason, one of the things you want is to execute in all phases at a level that makes you content that you've made progress. Going into the season opener, you want to feel like you're fielding a team that can compete. Right now, defensively, with the injuries and the youth and the way they looked against the Giants in the final game of the preseason, this defense has a long way to go. When the Giants come at you with plays that aren't too complex, but just test your fundamentals, and you can't execute those fundamentals, you could be in trouble. A simple reverse play. A simple tight end pass to the flat who is wide open. A simple off-tackle run. These are plays that should be going for 3-5 yards, but they end up being big plays. That's when you know you're not executing the way you should. Mike: On the flip side, it was easy to be impressed with the offense in the preseason. I thought the passing game looked sharp, with the integration of the tight ends giving the unit a more complete look. I also thought the running game was effective, thinking back to the third-and-short against the Giants that Fred Taylor converted with a strong situational run behind Sammy Morris. To me, a good running team is one that gets 2 yards when it needs 1. I think the Patriots have built some momentum in that area. Tedy: Tom Brady and the passing offense looks like it will be OK. I still wonder at the running back position. Right now, the Patriots are a team that passes to set up the run. The development of the tight ends is good. Overall, with what looks like problems defensively, this offense is going to have to score points. From a Tom Brady perspective, you get nervous having him drop back time and time again when there are some young players protecting him. Mike: Few could say that the Patriots' defense inspired confidence in those final two preseason games. Tedy: Right now, this defense has a lot of unproven youth. Then there are some players in the latter parts of their careers that are being counted on. How good can Gerard Warren be at the five-technique defensive end spot? They brought in Damione Lewis and hoped he could provide some depth there, but he's no longer on the roster. Mike Wright, up to this point in his career, has never been an every-down player. It looks like they're asking him to do that. When you have unproven players providing depth, it magnifies an injury like Ty Warren's. There's too much of a drop-off between Ty Warren and the next player. You have big questions at outside linebacker. And can Tully Banta-Cain produce like he did last year, with 10 sacks for the second year in a row? Those are some big question marks. Mike: We often say that reading into the preseason is dangerous, but after watching the 3-4 defense get sliced up by the Rams and Giants, it made me wonder if they should try something else. Tedy: I thought the exact same thing. All we have to go by now is what we've seen. And the last two games what we've seen is a Rams offense that had more than 90 plays, and then against the Giants in the final preseason game, all I wanted to focus on was the opening drive. That's really the team's focus in that game and the question \"Would they answer from last week?\" After what Coach Bill Belichick said about the Rams game, of course the starters were going to play. And they didn't respond on that opening drive. So I see a lot of question marks. You look at the defensive roster and circle the players who you know are going to get the job done, and I have two -- Vince Wilfork and Jerod Mayo. They've done it consistently. I still want to see another year from Brandon Meriweather before he gets put in that category. He made the Pro Bowl last year because of an injury situation, so does he think he arrived, or will he work to continue to get better? It's easier to make the Pro Bowl now. That's no longer a measuring stick. Mike: Tedy, rookie Brandon Spikes has emerged quickly at your old position. What have been some of your impressions of what you've seen? Tedy: He's obviously impressed the coaching staff to emerge as a starter and that's a tribute to the camp he had and the player he is. He's supposed to be very instinctive and that's what you need to be at the inside linebacker position. His challenge is only about to grow. As the regular season arrives and teams start game-planning, the defense changes and there are adjustments that change from week to week, sometimes day to day. So for example, coaches might say on Wednesday, \"This adjustment is how we're going to attack a certain formation.\" Then on Thursday the coaches might find that the adjustment is no longer applicable, so you have to be on your toes and communicate adjustments to the outside linebackers and safeties. It's going to be very difficult. When Jerod Mayo was a rookie, he was sandwiched between me and Mike Vrabel. We let him play and we could make adjustments as he learned. Now Jerod Mayo is in a position where he is comfortable enough to help Brandon Spikes. It's a mental process and you have to think very quickly. Mike: One of the surprising developments to me from the preseason is that 34-year-old Fred Taylor looks like the lead running back. At this stage of his career, he will no longer be a workhorse, but at least initially, I expect him to get the bulk of the carries. Tedy: I don't think the running game is going to be a huge threat from this team. If you're an opposing defense, you don't look at them and say \"I have to buckle up my chinstrap, here they come.\" That's not who they are. And when the Patriots attempt to do that, they know that's not who they are. They are about the passing offense. Whether it's Fred Taylor, Sammy Morris or Kevin Faulk, I think you can feel comfortable with them at running back. It's clear from the lack of playing time that Laurence Maroney received that the coaches aren't high on him now. Still, this will be about the pass -- Tom Brady throwing for 4,000 yards, Randy Moss vying for the league lead, Wes Welker's return to health. I would still worry about the offensive line because Logan Mankins' holdout sent a ripple effect through the entire offensive line. You had Kaczur out of position and that might have contributed to his injury, because you are absorbing contact from a different position. You lose Kaczur and now the tackle depth is hurt and you're also down to your third choice at left guard. You also have to ask if Stephen Neal can stay healthy, as he's had some health issues in the past. Mike: I think you're right Tedy, but why shouldn't the Patriots be more of an offense where defenses say \"We have to buckle our chinstraps and here they come\"? Tedy: I think defenders probably want them to run more, because every time Sammy Morris gets a carry, or Kevin Faulk gets a carry, it's one less pass attempt to Randy Moss and Wes Welker. The best players on the team are clearly Moss, Wes Welker and Tom Brady. As an offense, you want your best players to have the ball. The more passes they throw to the tight ends, the more times they hand it off, a defender will be saying \"Great, they're not going to Moss 40 yards down the field, or Wes Welker on an option route that he can turn into 20 yards.\" Mike: I remember we were at the ESPNBoston.com draft party at Gillette Stadium in April and you mentioned that Bill Belichick was still searching for next Mark Bavaro at tight end. You nailed that one. It looks like Rob Gronkowski, at 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, could be that big, physical, fast tight end that Bill Belichick has been seeking. Tedy: There has been good and bad with Rob Gronkowski. The good is that he's a big, strong, physical guy with great hands. You saw how he could be a threat down in the red zone. The bad was seen right before he caught that touchdown pass against the Giants. The play before, he cut off a \"7\" route to the back left pylon of the end zone. Tom Brady threw it there, thinking that he would be there. So that's where you see he's still a rookie. You don't quit running routes. He will develop over his rookie season, picking up the intricacies of the offense, which is difficult at the tight end position. You have to know pass routes and blocking schemes from different positions -- offset from the line, on the line of scrimmage, combo with the offensive tackle, pulling back across the line of scrimmage to trap a defensive lineman. It's one of the most difficult positions to learn. Mike: Let's also touch on special teams, where the return game looks like it will get a boost from Brandon Tate. Special teams coach Scott O'Brien said earlier in the preseason that the kickoff return unit was one area where he'd like to see improvement. Tedy: Special teams can be an X factor that helps them this year. We saw after the Giants scored, they got a huge kickoff return and that made it a short field, to set up the offense for a score. Also, Stephen Gostkowski is one of the best kickers. He deserves every penny of his contract extension. That's why I drafted him in my fantasy league. Mike: Another hot topic this offseason has been the coaching staff, with no official coordinators. Tedy: Offensively, Bill O'Brien looks like the unnamed coordinator. You could tell during the preseason who was calling the shots and who Tom Brady was talking to. Defensively, second in command to Bill Belichick looks like Matt Patricia. He appears to be the one who is consulting with Bill on the sidelines, making adjustments, and wearing the headset and communicating with players through the coach-to-player communication device. So he looks like the unnamed defensive coordinator right now. Mike: Let's wrap it up, Tedy, and we'll come back later this week with a \"Breakdown\" specifically on the opening game against the Bengals. I've predicted a 10-6 season for the Patriots. Tedy: From my experience, I've been on teams before where you look terrible in the preseason and come out gangbusters in the regular season. Looking at the Patriots this preseason, are there things to be worried about? I'd say, \"Yes, there are.\" But perspective is important, too. There is a different tempo from preseason to regular season and playing four quarters. That's different than playing a quarter or a quarter and a half in a preseason game. There have been games where I've been on a team that played terrible in the first quarter, but by the fourth quarter it was a victory. Based on what's out there now, what's been shown, I expect the Patriots to be well coached and fundamentally sound. If you give the coaching staff this time to prepare, as well as some veteran players, it's plenty of time to address any type of problems they may have on the field. I anticipate a successful season.

He enters my rankings at the top of the list, and I don't expect him to fall from that perch in terms of the impact he makes on his team during his rookie campaign. The upgrade at the running back position during the preseason for Chargers has been stunning. Ryan Mathews shows a burst LaDainian Tomlinson has not in several years. And Ryan Mathews runs with anger and aggression, rarely being brought down by the first tackler. He is quick and decisive. Ryan Mathews can churn out the tough yardage and move the chains or he can hit the home run. He also has soft hands and intriguing receiving skills. Chargers coach Norv Turner should not hesitate to dump a huge workload on Ryan Mathews' shoulders. That is what he was drafted to do, and Norv Turner has a history of turning talented runners into stars. In their regular-season opener, the Chargers travel to Chiefs for a matchup on \"Monday Night Football.\" Ryan Mathews and safety Eric Berry, who opens the season at number 7 on my list, get to battle head to head, as Eric Berry is sure to spend some time near the line of scrimmage to help the Chiefs' ailing front seven.

Johnson", "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "Darrelle Revis. Signed. Sealed. Delivered. Ben Roethlisberger. Humbled. Matt Leinart. Good luck with that, Texans. Brett Favre. Zzzzzz. You're excused for believing those were the most compelling stories of the NFL's most colorful offseason. Even toss in T.O.'s fretting, Albert Haynesworth's tests (and possible starring role in Return to the Titans) and Ochocinco's tweeting and you're still off base. Those may have been the loudest headlines, the moves that kept local sports talk shows buzzing and the names that led \"SportsCenter\" most nights. But the most intriguing -- and potentially the most impactful -- storyline is still unfolding in Raiders. Yes, Raiders, capital of Raider Nation. For years the place hasn't produced compelling football, though the Raiders have been the source of enough horror tales to terrorize Harry Potter until he qualifies for Social Security. So it's easy to overlook this one. But as the 2010 NFL season begins few sagas will be worth following more than the fate of Jason Campbell, the Raiders' new QB. Raiders isn't the only team with a new man behind center, but no team's need for leadership (and just plain old competence) is as dire. Campell, who was obtained in a trade with Redskins in April for a fourth-round pick, may be the team's best QB since, oh, Rich Gannon, who's the last Raiders QB to lead the team to a winning record (11-5 in the 2002 regular season). Jason Campbell won't make anyone forget Kenny Stabler or Jim Plunkett, but he just might help Raider faithful forget about (or at least heal from) JaMarcus Russell. Like Gannon, Jason Campbell isn't flashy, just solid. He has 55 touchdown passes with just 38 interceptions since being drafted in the first round in 2005. (His ratio is akin to Gannons' 180 TDs and 104 INTs.) He's started 52 games and has a career passing rating of 82.3. (Gannon's career rating was 84.7. Russell's, in three abysmal seasons, was 65.2, and the 50.0 he recorded last season was the lowest in 11 NFL seasons.) Most important to Raiders fans, Jason Campbell is only 28 and on the upswing. He's improved in completion percentage, touchdowns and QB rating in each of his four pro seasons while playing under four different offensive coordinators. \"I feel I can be a pretty good quarterback in this league. It's a new beginning,\" he told the San Jose Mercury News this week. \"It would mean the world to me if I could help turn around the Raiders.\" Reality check: Jason Campbell's record as a starter is a loathsome 20-32, not exactly Gannonesque (45-29 in six seasons as a Raider). And he's been sacked more times (102) than Samantha Jones (yes, gratuitous \"Sex and the City\" reference!). Moreover he was not without his critics in Redskins, where he never seemed to be as good as fill-in-the-blank desired quarterback. If there was a quarterback Redskins didn't try to obtain while Jason Campbell was there, please raise your hand... thought so. Still, Jason Campbell's better than any of Raiders's alternatives. His success is vital for the franchise, which has had only three winning seasons in its last 15. The Raiders' 3-1 preseason record, which included a win over Cowboys, has fans practically hyperventilating. Raiders has been the NFL's laughing stock, the league's version of the Clippers. And that's a shame for a team with such a storied pro football history, one that piqued sports fans across the nation at a time when the league was growing into a true national sport. Love'em or not, the Raiders were vital to that growth and are one of the game's defining franchises. \u2022 Iconoclastic owner, Al Davis. \u2022 Legends such as Stabler, Plunkett, Howie Long, Art Shell, Fred Biletnikoff and the late Gene Upshaw. (The busts of 13 Raiders players or coaches sit in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.) \u2022 Frenzied fans who transform every fall Sunday into Halloween in the East Bay. And the NFL needs them. It needs the Raiders to be good. Why? Believe it or not, these are fragile times for the most formidable juggernaut in sports. The recession and its uncertain aftermath have sacked values throughout the league. Last month, Forbes reported that 21 of 32 teams saw their overall value drop in the last year and that the average value of NFL teams declined 2 percent, the first slide since the magazine began tracking franchise values 12 years ago. (Not surprisingly, the Raiders, valued at just $758 million, were valued higher than only one team, Jaguars.) Non-broadcast revenue also declined because of diminishing corporate sponsorships and ticket prices blindsided by market forces. It all means that now, for the first time in a long time, the NFL must be certain is does not lose the typical fan who can't afford a ticket, or maybe even one of the fancy television packages. And to retain that guy, teams like the Raiders need to be solid not silly. \"To attract the casual fan, it helps to have the brand teams do well,\" says Kevin Sullivan, a Cowboys-based strategic communications consultant. \"Dynasties, as much as we love to hate them, are good for business.\" And not just at the turnstiles. This summer the Licensing Letter, which tracks the industry, predicted that major league baseball will sell slightly more licensed merchandise ($2.75 billion) that the NFL ($2.7 billion). The Raiders are the original bad boys in black and one of the league's premier \"national\" teams, along with Cowboys, Packers and now the Saints. Their merchandise was once the top-selling NFL brand. No longer. The most recent Turnkey Team Brand Index ranked the Raiders 90th among 120 North American pro sports franchises. For that to change, the Raiders need to just win, baby. \"[They're] still a national brand,\" says Sullivan. \"But to sell merchandise you have to win. When they win again, you'll start seeing more Raiders gear.\" With Jason Campbell, the Raiders finally have a chance to regain at least a portion of their past glory. And if they do, it'll be one heck of a story. Roy S. Johnson, a veteran sports journalist and media consultant, is the editor-in-chief of Men's Fitness. His blog is Ballers, Gamers and Scoundrels.

When will USC pay back all the money it earned because of Reggie Bush's stardom? When will the school's athletic department return the money it made from selling his jerseys, or the multimillion-dollar BCS bowl payouts it received because Reggie Bush's talents helped win a lot of games? And how soon should we expect a check from former USC coach Pete Carroll, one that will cover the financial bonuses he received for going 37-2 and winning two national championships while Reggie Bush was his player? Should we set them up on a payment plan? According to a Yahoo Sports report on Tuesday, the Heisman Trophy Trust will strip Reggie Bush of the most prestigious individual award in college football by the end of September and leave it vacated -- which perhaps would be the last hypocritical nail in the Reggie Bush scandal. That hammer might not swing until some time in the future (ESPN's Chris Fowler was told by his sources that the Heisman trustees are still undecided about what to do with Reggie Bush's trophy), but even the news that some people are thinking of rescinding Reggie Bush's Heisman means they have failed to realize that exacting a pound of flesh from Reggie Bush would be ineffectual within such a broken system. We know some past Heisman winners are hardly paragons of virtue. Billy Cannon was sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a counterfeiting operation. Billy Sims sold his Heisman to cover a multitude of debts and spent a month in jail for owing $32,900 in back child support. But Reggie Bush, who has committed no criminal acts, has done something so distasteful it warrants his trophy being taken? Even 1968 Heisman winner O.J. Simpson, who is currently serving a 33-year prison term for his role in an armed robbery and previously beat a double-murder charge, thinks the Heisman trustees are being phony. I understand rules were broken, but the continued castigation of Reggie Bush evades the real problem, which is the exploitation of college athletes. The continued punishing of Reggie Bush gives the comfortable illusion that the powers that be in college sports are serious about reprimanding college athletes and universities who break the rules. But as long as it remains a broken system, any punishment of Reggie Bush is hollow. If the NCAA really wanted to prevent situations such as Reggie Bush's, it would hammer these schools harder for their willing ignorance. It would levy serious, six- or seven-figure fines against these schools, hit them with significant double-digit scholarship losses and suspend the coaches who are overseeing renegade programs. Or, the NCAA could create a system that financially compensates revenue-generating athletes, reducing the temptation of inappropriate payments. If the Heisman Trust wants to create a new standard of behavior for its winners, then it shouldn't start with Reggie Bush. It should start with players such as Sims, Simpson and Cannon. No matter what's done to Reggie Bush, it won't stop college athletes from taking money and other gifts. It won't stop schools from looking the other way when they see their players driving expensive cars they can't possibly afford. And unfortunately, it won't stop the NCAA from prostituting athletes for millions, and then blaming them when they want their cut. If the Heisman trustees believe taking away Reggie Bush's Heisman is supposed to shame him, then you can bet a lot of college athletes can't wait to be humiliated. Becoming the first player in the Heisman's 75-year history to have his trophy taken away is undoubtedly embarrassing, but Reggie Bush was the number 2 pick in the NFL draft, has won a Super Bowl and has made untold millions. Why would he regret anything that happened at USC? He shouldn't, and neither should any college athlete who mimics Reggie Bush's college path. Besides, they can take away Reggie Bush's Heisman, but it's not as if we won't remember Reggie Bush's 1,740 yards and 16 touchdowns rushing that season. Regardless of the NCAA fallout, people still mention the Fab Five (whose Final Four appearances were vacated by the NCAA) as one of the greatest teams in college basketball history. Punishing Reggie Bush won't give the Heisman Trophy added integrity. Just a scapegoat. Jemele Hill can be reached at jemeleespn@gmail.com.

Bears linebacker Lance Briggs, meanwhile, was dressed in full pads and was observed participating in individual drills during the open portion of practice Wednesday. Lance Briggs had been sidelined since suffering an ankle injury in the Bears third preseason game against Cardinals on Aug. 28. The Bears listed Lance Briggs as having limited participation on the official injury report. \"I'm out there doing everything,\" Major Wright said before Wednesday's practice. Major Wright, expected to be active for Sunday's matchup against the Lions, has drawn considerable praise from coaches and teammates, leading many to believe the rookie will challenge for a starting job at safety. \"I have no clue,\" Major Wright said about his role in Week 1. \"Right now my role on the team is to go out and play special teams and do whatever I can. [Special teams] are another phase of the game. If I can help with that, I'm willing to do it.\" Asking any first-year player to step in and start a season opener is risky, but Bears coach Lovie Smith has a history of turning to first-year safeties. In 2009, Al Afalava, a sixth-round pick who failed to make this year's 53-man roster, opened up at strong safety in Packers last September, while Danieal Manning and Chris Harris also played right away in their respective rookie seasons. The difference in this case, however, is that Major Wright missed three preseason games due to injury. \"The learning process has never stopped, and I feel the coaches have been good to me and my teammates have been bringing me along and [helping] me,\" Major Wright said. \"It's just grasping the whole defense, getting all your concepts, your reads and keys. \"I don't feel like I'm behind, I'm just going out and preparing myself well.\" The only player who skipped practice was safety Craig Steltz (high ankle sprain), who continues to work on the side with a member of the team's medical staff.

All three of those players filled significant roles last season on an NFC East championship team that ended a dozen-year playoff win drought. But the Cowboys dumped the millionaire veterans, promoting Doug Free, Alan Ball and Kevin Ogletree and counting on the players with six-figure salaries to perform. That's the way internal competition often works in the NFL. If it's close to even, the more expensive dude is usually leaving. \"It's,'How do you want your team to progress?'\" said executive vice president Stephen Felix Jones, emphasizing that age is a more important factor than finances. \"If you're always keeping the veteran guys over the young guys then you ultimately become an old team, and that bites you at some point. \"So we felt like we had to continue to bring along these young players. They'll improve and they'll get better.\" That's a fine philosophy. In fact, the spring releases of two starters were met with raves from this keyboard. That's because Flozell Adams and Hamlin have hit the downsides of their careers, and Doug Free and Alan Ball proved during fill-in stints last season that they were ready for increased roles. The younger players will probably be upgrades in both of those cases. All of which leads us to a simple question: Why are Marion Barber and Roy Williams still reporting to work at Valley Ranch? Oh, yeah, that's right. They both have contracts that guarantee them megamillions this year. That's another NFL reality. Owners really don't like mailing rich checks each week to players who aren't even on the roster. (Especially when the owner doubles as the general manager and is reluctant to admit contractual mistakes until that player has been replaced.) It's understandable that a contract can assure a player a roster spot. But it's unacceptable for a contract to guarantee a player a major role, especially for a team like the Cowboys that expects to contend for the Super Bowl. This isn't necessarily a call to bench Marion Barber and Roy Williams now. However, the coaching staff can't hesitate to make a change if it's apparent that a more productive option is playing a lesser role. We know there's a player ready to take over Marion Barber's role. We're not referring to Felix Jones, the home run threat who will be a big part of the Cowboys' two-pronged rushing attack as long as he stays healthy. The issue is whether Tashard Choice would complement Felix Jones better than Marion Barber does. For now, Choice plays on third downs, gets an occasional snap out of the Razorback formation and settles for scraps. Choice has feasted when given the chance. He's been given at least eight carries in eight games during his two-season career, all when injuries forced the coaching staff's hand. His numbers from that half-season of work -- 589 yards and four touchdowns on 113 carries (5.2 yards per carry) and 27 catches for 252 yards (9.3 per) -- compare favorably with Marion Barber's career averages and far surpass his production since he became the starter. Marion Barber has been a September beast (5.0 yards per carry) and a December bum (2.9 yards per carry) the past two seasons. Durability has been an issue for the back whose style is to lower his shoulder and look for contact, but he's too tough to sit out games. Perhaps the most puzzling decision by the Cowboys' coaches last season was to keep counting on a wounded Marion Barber instead of increasing Choice's workload. Why ride a horse with a strained quad and broken thumb when there is a healthy one in the stable? We believe there's a receiver on the roster ready to replace Roy Williams, whose poor production since arriving from Lions is a well-worn topic. There's no doubt that first-round pick Dez Bryant has take-your-breath-away talent. The rookie has to prove that he can run precise, correct routes to earn Tony Romo's trust. Then again, Roy Williams is still working on that as well. As long as Dez Bryant stays out of trouble and the trainers' room, it's a matter of time before he takes Roy Williams' job. The latest it will happen is at the beginning of next season. With the guaranteed money in his contract already paid, Roy Williams will be gone. Marion Barber, whose $4.25 million salary next season isn't guaranteed, might be in the same boat as Roy Williams, with Choice due to make about one-eighth that much. If Marion Barber and Roy Williams continue to fail to play up to their contracts, the transition to their successors might as well be made this season. Rest assured that Wade Phillips would handle such a situation with a delicate touch. It's doubtful that a demotion would ever be made official, much like Greg Ellis' final season with the Cowboys, when the veteran started but played fewer snaps than Anthony Spencer. Marion Barber and Roy Williams aren't old yet, but they certainly seem to have hit their ceilings. Dez Bryant and Choice ooze with untapped potential. The younger players need an opportunity to progress. A team with Super Bowl aspirations needs production. At running back and receiver, those missions might not be mutually exclusive for the Cowboys.

Season ticket sales declined for the third year in a row as teams struggle to get fans to the stadium in a weak economy. Depending on the final numbers, season ticket sales will be down between 1 percent and 2 percent, according to Eric Grubman, the league's executive vice president for business ventures. \"I wouldn't say we're pleased,\" Grubman said Wednesday on the eve of the season opener between Vikings and Saints. Still, the drop could have been worse given the financial climate in the United States, he said. \"It's been a tough economic time, and we have a sport that's full of passion and competition, and people love that,\" he said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \"So, by virtue of that, people really do try to hold onto their season tickets or buy new ones if they can.\" Grubman said overall attendance declined from 17 million in 2008 to 16.6 million last year. Average regular-season attendance dropped from each year from 2006 (68,774) to 2009 (67,509), according to STATS LLC. \"It's hard to draw a pattern across 32 clubs,\" Grubman said. \"There are clearly some clubs that are down more than others. It would be a special circumstance for a club to be up. I think in general the trend is flat to down, and clubs that have perennially sold out tickets, they've probably held their own and are flat.\" Grubman said most teams left their average ticket price relatively unchanged. The Team Marketing Report has not released 2010 figures. \"I believe our average ticket price is up slightly, and that is the consequence in all likelihood of opening of new stadiums,\" he said.

Safety concerns prompted the NFL's competition committee to move the umpires, who spot the ball, from the middle of the defense to behind the deepest back in the backfield. The vote came in March after supporters cited an increase in collisions between players and umpires. One of those voting to approve the proposal was Colts president Bill Polian, and during the Colts' first two preseason games, the complaints were muted. Of course, Peyton Manning was only around for six combined series in the games. Everything changed after Peyton Manning's longest preseason stint Aug. 26 at Packers. The four-time league MVP was clearly frustrated that the umpire couldn't get into his established position quickly enough for Peyton Manning to snap the ball. And after being called for a second illegal snap, Peyton Manning reacted by waving his hands in disgust at the official. Afterward, Peyton Manning called the first penalty \"ridiculous\" and contended the offense should have been given a warning before getting a 5-yard penalty. Polian later called the problems easily solvable. Now Peyton Manning has gotten his wish -- sort of. Last week, the league moved umpires back to their previous spot for the final two minutes of the first half and the last five minutes of the game. On Tuesday, the league sent a memo to all 32 teams detailing additional tweaks. Umpires will now return to their old spot during the final two minutes of the first half, the last five minutes of the game and on all plays when the offense is inside the opponents' 5-yard line. \"From what I understand, it gives them a better view of whether the runner has crossed the goal line,\" Colts coach Jim Caldwell said. The other changes may be more to Peyton Manning's liking. Quarterbacks can now snap the ball when the umpire gets behind the deepest back in the backfield, not necessarily when he's in position, a move of about three yards that should allow Indy to again increase the tempo. And officials will have the discretion to warn the offense or immediately impose a penalty. \"They can give you a warning, but I think that's pretty much out of the goodness of the referee's heart,\" Peyton Manning said, drawing laughter. \"I'd like one [warning], but my understanding is that they don't have to give you one.\" Peyton Manning, Jim Caldwell and Pro Bowl center Jeff Saturday declined to say what, if anything, would be done differently in Sunday's season-opener at Texans. But Jim Caldwell thinks the changes will help the Colts stay in sync. \"I think we'll get a flow, a feel for how we're operating and adjust accordingly,\" he said. \"All I know is that we have to play with it this fall, and our job is to win games.\" The other contentious issue in Indy has been Anthony Gonzalez's role this weekend. Indy's first-round pick in 2007 is coming back from a season-ending knee injury and appears to be penciled in as the Colts' number 4 receiver behind Pro Bowler Reggie Wayne, Pierre Garcon and Austin Collie. Gonzalez is also listed as the Colts' top punt returner, a job he's almost never held. On Monday, Gonzalez sounded frustrated. Jim Caldwell responded Wednesday by blaming himself if there was a communication gap. \"The best way to sum it up is that in that locker room we have probably some of the most competitive men who have an unbelievable, obsessive desire to be on top,\" Peyton Manning said. \"That's something you have to consider. Anything that deals with communication is strictly my fault. But we do have a 53-man roster and a 16-game season and everybody has a role to play. We need all 53 guys to win, and he's one of those 53.\" Peyton Manning didn't address that issue. Instead, he's trying to make sure nothing gets in the way of Indy's offense Sunday. \"I guess it's kind of like telling the left tackle'You have to move up a little bit,\" Peyton Manning said. \"He [the ref] can tell you that. But he can just throw a flag, too.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5547244", "Entities": ["Peyton Manning", "Colts", "Packers", "Jim Caldwell", "Jeff Saturday", "Texans", "Reggie Wayne", "Pierre Garcon"]}, {"title": "Bears' Jay Cutler is confident", "author": null, "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "After quarterback Jay Cutler struggled during his first season with the Bears, the team's beleaguered leadership brought in renowned coordinator Mike Martz to help turn things around. With the offense still trying to work out the kinks ahead of Sunday's opener, Jay Cutler is stressing patience -- but the Bears can't afford to get off to a bad start as they try to snap a three-year string of missing the playoffs. Bears kicks off the 2010 season by hosting the NFC North rival Lions, who are hoping to see progress from young quarterback Matthew Stafford. Not known for having successful quarterbacks, the Bears acquired Jay Cutler from Broncos for Kyle Orton and three draft picks last April. In his third year as a full-time starter in 2009, Jay Cutler had the second-most passing yards in franchise history with 3,666 and finished two shy of Erik Kramer's club record of 29 touchdowns set in 1995. However, Jay Cutler also had a league-high 26 interceptions, the most for Bears since Sid Luckman's team-record 31 in 1947, and his 76.8 passer rating was 21st in the NFL. To correct those problems, the Bears (7-9) turned to Martz, the coordinator for the high-powered Rams when they won the 2000 Super Bowl. Martz spent the last three years refurbishing offenses in 49ers and Lions, but the Bears have struggled to get a handle on his system. They ranked near the bottom of the league in yards per game and points during the preseason, scoring on three of 16 possessions with Jay Cutler at the helm and giving up a league-worst 19 sacks. \"Is there a reason for concern? Maybe, maybe not,\" Jay Cutler said. \"I'm not concerned. I don't think anybody in that locker room is really concerned of where we're at. I think we're happy where we're at. There's room to improve, absolutely, but I think we'll be ready.\" The Bears need their running game to take some of the pressure off Jay Cutler. Matt Forte finished third in the league in total yards as a rookie with 1,238 on the ground and 477 through the air, but he wasn't as good last year. He ran for 929 yards as the Bears finished 29th in rushing and 23rd in total offense. To spur some competition, Bears signed veteran Chester Taylor in March. After rushing for 1,216 yards with Vikings in 2006, Taylor served as a second option behind Adrian Peterson with the Vikings the past three seasons. The Bears looked to bolster their defense by signing end Julius Peppers to a six-year deal worth as much as $91.5 million. Julius Peppers has the third-most sacks in the NFL with 81 over his eight seasons and recorded 10\u00bd in 2009 with Panthers. In his Bears debut, he'll look to get Matthew Stafford's second season off to a rocky start. The number 1 overall draft pick last year completed just 53.3 percent of his attempts and had 20 interceptions to 13 touchdowns during 10 starts. The Lions signed wide receiver Nate Burleson to complement top target Calvin Johnson, and added first-round running back Jahvid Best, tight end Tony Scheffler and guard Rob Sims. \"We're much improved on offense,\" coach Jim Schwartz said. \"We have a lot more weapons, and our quarterback has taken a big jump.\" Before taking Jahvid Best with the 30th overall selection, Lions drafted a potential franchise cornerstone in defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh from Nebraska with the number 2 pick. The Lions are looking for Ndamukong Suh to provide an immediate boost to a team that ranked last in total defense at 392.1 yards per game, 25th against the run (126.6 ypg) and 29th in sacks (26) during a 2-14 season. Lions has lost a league-worst 111 games since the start of the 2001 season and 20 in a row on the road since a 16-7 win at Soldier Field on Oct. 28, 2007. The Lions set the NFL record with 24 consecutive road losses from 2001-03.

Smith led the NFL in kickoff returns in 2009 with an average of 29.1 yards. But he was slowed by injuries last year and during the Bucs' recent training camp.

LOUIS -- After one practice, new Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton thought he'd be ready in time for Sunday's opener against Cardinals. Rookie quarterback Sam Bradford was optimistic, too, after seeing Clayton in action on Wednesday. Sam Bradford said it appeared Clayton already had a \"great grasp\" of the offense. \"He didn't ask a lot of questions,\" Sam Bradford said. \"He just got in the huddle, I called the play and he knew where to go, knew where to line up and knew what to run. \"I think he's got a lot of speed. I think if we can get him the ball, he can definitely do some things with it.\" Coach Steve Spagnuolo also thought Clayton was a quick learner after noting he knew where to line up during a pre-practice walkthrough. The Rams acquired Clayton on Monday from the Ravens, who needed to make room for T.J. Houshmandzadeh. He adds needed experience at the position, especially after deep threat Donnie Avery was lost with a knee injury in the preseason. Clayton and Sam Bradford are both Oklahoma products and worked together on some 7 on 7 drills the summer before Sam Bradford's junior year with the Sooners. Clayton text messaged Sam Bradford after he signed with the Rams as the number 1 pick. The veteran receiver had gotten a crash course on the offense from coaches to ease the learning curve, and told them he didn't care where he lined up, just that he played. \"I've been all over,\" he said. \"Backfield, running, I can throw it, kick it. Whatever you need.\" Clayton has nine 100-yard receiving games, most in Ravens history, and in 2006 he caught 67 passes for a team-leading 939 yards and five touchdowns. His reception totals declined each season after that and he's looking forward to a fresh start with the Rams. \"You've got to have the ball thrown your way to catch them,\" Clayton said. \"What matters is right now and what matters is moving in the right direction and winning games.\" Before the trade, Clayton was with a playoff team. He didn't seem to mind landing with a team that landed the number 1 pick. \"The difference between a champion and a team that has won a game is very minute,\" he said. \"It all comes down to just details, fundamentals and being consistent It's not killing yourself, especially for this offense.\" NOTES: Players voted running back Steven Jackson and free safety Oshiomoghe Atogwe team captains for the season. Steve Spagnuolo will name two additional captains each week, with long snapper Chris Massey and defensive end James Hall honored for the opener.... Strong safety James Butler (knee) returned to limited participation but the starter will be Craig Dahl, who made eight starts last season....

The club is well stocked with quality at quarterback, receiver and tight end. And while there are no consistent breakaway threats at running back and there are depth concerns along the offensive line, those units still have productive players who are talented enough to help win ballgames. There is less certainty on defense, where questions remain on whether the line will be able to hold up at the point of attack and whether there is a viable option to start at one outside linebacker spot. Also, the secondary is young and relatively untested. Here is a look at the roster, position by position, while considering where it ranks from an NFL perspective: Quarterback (2) Starter: Tom Brady Backup: Brian Hoyer Analysis: For the second straight season, the team will keep just two players at the position. About half the clubs in the NFL kept just two signal-callers in 2009. Tom Brady was sharp this preseason, while Hoyer, who made the club as a rookie free agent last season, showed that he continues to make positive strides. Overall, the Patriots' personnel at the position ranks as one of the NFL's best. Running back (5) Starter: Fred Taylor Backups: Kevin Faulk, Sammy Morris, Laurence Maroney, BenJarvus Green-Ellis Analysis: While the Patriots aren't going to morph into a Jets -style ground-and-pound attack, there were some promising signs in the preseason when it came to situational, short-yardage running with Taylor and Morris. That's why they project to get the ball over Maroney at the start of the year. Faulk remains a weapon as a pass-catcher out of the backfield. With Taylor, Morris and Faulk all in their 30s, Maroney and BenJarvus Green-Ellis provide youthful depth and insurance should injuries strike. This unit ranks low from an overall NFL perspective, in part because there is not a clear number 1 back in the group. Wide receiver (6) Starters: Randy Moss, Wes Welker, Brandon Tate Backups: Julian Edelman, Taylor Price, Matthew Slater Analysis: Moss looks motivated to have a big year and, as he showed in the preseason, he can still run well and threaten opponents in the deep third of the field. Meanwhile, Wes Welker's recovery from a torn ACL and MCL has been quicker than anticipated, and Brandon Tate and Julian Edelman appear primed to make significant leaps from their rookie seasons, assuming they stay healthy. This looks like it could be one of the NFL's more explosive receiving groups. Tight ends (3) Starter: Alge Crumpler Backups: Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez Analysis: When training camp began, the Patriots were the only team in the NFL to not bring back a tight end from 2009, and the revamped group showed in the preseason that it figures to play a major role in the team's attack. Alge Crumpler is a powerful blocker in the running game and still is a factor in the short to intermediate passing game, while the 6-foot-6, 265-pound Rob Gronkowski looks like an X-factor who could help the team improve in the red zone. Aaron Hernandez is a chess piece who figures to be moved all over the field. If what transpired in the preseason carries to the regular season, the Patriots could have an upper-tier group from an NFL perspective. Offensive line (9) Starters: Matt Light (LT), Dan Connolly (LG), Dan Koppen (C), Stephen Neal (RG), Sebastian Vollmer (RT) Backups: Mark LeVoir (OT), Ryan Wendell (C/G), Quinn Ojinnaka (OT/G), Steve Maneri (OT) Injured: Nick Kaczur (OT/G) Analysis: The Patriots are holding a roster spot for Kaczur at this point, with the hope that he might recover from an injured back to help at some point. The starting line had a solid preseason, but the questions come in the depth department. Ojinnaka, who was acquired in a trade with the Falcons, is suspended for the season's first game and does not count against the roster limit. When he comes back, the team will have to trim from somewhere to create room. The offensive line without Logan Mankins looks like it's middle of the pack when compared with other NFL clubs. Defensive line (7) Starters: Gerard Warren (LDE), Vince Wilfork (NT), Mike Wright (RDE) Backups: Ron Brace (LDE), Myron Pryor (NT), Brandon Deaderick (RDE), Kyle Love (NT) Analysis: Ty Warren's season-ending hip injury is a significant blow and altered the Patriots' initial plans to have a Ty Warren /Vince Wilfork/Gerard Warren starting trio. The trickle-down effect is that Gerard Warren moves to the left side and Wright becomes a full-time player. Wright is one of the team's best interior pass rushers and projects to stay on the field on third down, so the concern is that he might wear down with a full-time role. Brace looks like a better fit at end than nose, and if he emerges as a starter, that would be a big boost. Deadrick (late seventh-round pick) and Kyle Love (rookie free agent) beat the odds to earn spots as developmental types. From an NFL perspective, this position looks like a middle-of-the-pack group. Linebacker (9) Starters: Tully Banta-Cain (OLB), Jerod Mayo (ILB), Brandon Spikes (ILB) Backups: Jermaine Cunningham (OLB), Marques Murrell (OLB), Rob Ninkovich (OLB), Gary Guyton (ILB), Dane Fletcher (ILB), Tracy White (ILB) Analysis: The Patriots play a 3-4 alignment so they'll need to find a starter on the outside among the group of Jermaine Cunningham, Murrell and Rob Ninkovich. At this point, it is a challenge to name any of them starters as they don't have a career start between them. Murrell started the first two preseason games, so he looks like the opening-day starter by process of elimination. Jermaine Cunningham, a second-round draft choice out of Florida, has missed all four preseason games because of injury but could find himself thrown into the fire quickly. On the inside, Brandon Spikes stepped in for the injured Gary Guyton on the fourth day of camp and hasn't looked back. From a league point of view, the Patriots have one of the more promising groups at inside linebacker, but the questions on the outside drag them down to the back half of the NFL. Defensive back (9) Starters: Devin McCourty (LCB), Darius Butler (RCB), Brandon Meriweather (S), Patrick Chung (S) Backups: Jonathan Wilhite (CB), Kyle Arrington (CB), Terrence Wheatley (CB), James Sanders (S), Jarrad Page (S) Analysis: Bill Belichick has never entered a season with such a young secondary, which is a result of losing eight-year veteran cornerback Leigh Bodden (torn rotator cuff) and sixth-year veteran safety Brandon McGowan (torn pectoral muscle) to season-ending injuries. The performance of this group will reflect, in part, how well the team drafted because all four starters were selected within the draft's first 41 picks -- Devin McCourty a 2010 first-round pick, Butler a 2009 second-round pick, Brandon Meriweather a 2007 first-round pick and Patrick Chung a 2009 second-round pick. NFL-wise, the secondary has the potential to be a top group, but until they prove it, they reside in the middle. Specialists (3) Starters: Stephen Gostkowski (kicker), Zoltan Mesko (punter/holder); Jake Ingram (long snapper) Analysis: There was no significant competition for any of the three jobs as the Patriots have done well in recent years identifying top specialists in the draft and then scooping other teams to select them. Stephen Gostkowski is a Pro Bowl-caliber kicker and how he adjusts to the new field-goal operation with Zoltan Mesko as his holder will be important to monitor. As far as specialists go in the NFL, this group has potential to be among the best. Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPN Boston.

The NFL and the NFLPA have several issues to negotiate, including the amount of the league's revenue going to players, an 18-game schedule, expanded drug testing and a rookie wage scale before a new collective bargaining agreement can be reached. In an interview with ESPN Radio's \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\" on Wednesday, commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the league's labor talks. \"We have a lot of work to get done. There's still sufficient time to do that. But there's really a window here. This deal is going to be easier to make between now and, let's say, March,\" Goodell said. \"Once we get to March it just becomes more complicated and more difficult, so we really need to work hard in the next several months to try to get something that works for the players, works for the owners and works for the game.\" Goodell explained why it would become more difficult to negotiate a new deal in March. \"You get into when you don't have a system and potentially you start getting loss of revenues. And when you have loss of revenue there's less money for us to negotiate over. That's always a harder situation for anyone to negotiate in,\" Goodell told ESPN Radio. In the deal the NFL opted out of after last season, players received approximately 60 percent of revenue after $1 billion was kept by the owners. The NFL wants to increase that amount to $2 billion to help with the increasing costs of stadium construction and operations. \"If this model is not working, i.e. teams are losing money, then we're willing to see the evidence of that and make the changes,\" Smith told Bloomberg News. \"But prove it. If not, what's the justification for getting a billion back from us?\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5546088", "Entities": []}, {"title": "Two Cowboys O-linemen hurting", "author": null, "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "IRVING, Texas -- Tony Romo might be without two of his main blockers in the opener Sunday night at Redskins. Cowboys right tackle Marc Colombo and left guard Kyle Kosier missed practice again Wednesday because of knee injuries suffered during training camp, leaving little time for them to prove they are healthy enough to play this weekend. Marc Colombo is the surprise. He was supposed to have been back a week ago based on the initial timetable when he underwent arthroscopic surgery. \"If he doesn't practice this week, I would say he probably wouldn't play,\" coach Wade Phillips said. Kyle Kosier sprained a ligament and is three weeks into a recovery that was expected to take 4 to 6 weeks. Cowboys has veteran backups for both: Alex Barron at right tackle and Montrae Holland at left guard. Barron was acquired from Rams during the offseason to provide depth at both tackle spots. Montrae Holland was with Cowboys last season, but was inactive for all 16 games. Both started in place of the starters during the preseason. Wade Phillips said going with a pair of backups wouldn't change the game plan much. \"I think the strength of the guys that are in there, Barron and Montrae Holland, are comparable to what we have so you don't have to change too much,\" he said. \"Marc Colombo pulled and did some things like that; well, Barron can do that. Montrae is a guard similar to what Kyle Kosier does. It's not a big change as far as the plays you run. And both can pass protect.\" The Rams gave up on Barron because he never lived up to expectations as a first-round pick. He was slowed by injuries during training camp. \"The more work he gets, the more confidence we'll have in him,\" Wade Phillips said. Montrae Holland has drawn multiple penalties for false starts in the preseason. The Cowboys could use as many healthy linemen as they can get after struggling to move the ball during the preseason. They've said bland play-calling was mostly to blame, calling their practices crisp and vowing to be ready to improve on last season, when they set a franchise record for yards but scored fewer points than the previous season, when they missed the playoffs.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=5548049", "Entities": ["Tony Romo", "Redskins", "Cowboys", "Marc Colombo", "Kyle Kosier", "Wade Phillips", "Montrae Holland", "Rams"]}, {"title": "Rivals and friends? Isn't that unhealthy?", "author": null, "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "The longest preseason since the 1960s has finally ended and the Cowboys are preparing to play a real game Sunday night in the greater Redskins area, which unfortunately includes Landover, Md. Will Sunday night's game live up to this past Monday's game at FedEx Stadium between Boise State and Virginia Tech? I highly doubt it, because neither team has a quarterback like Kellen Moore. But with all the questions swirling around these two teams, it should be an intriguing matchup. Before I head out to Valley Ranch to visit with Donovan McNabb via the miracle of the conference call, let's take a look at what I think are the top five storylines heading into Sunday's game. If you're so inclined, please respond to this column in the \"comments\" section so that editors will continue to run it each Wednesday. 1. The Cowboys have to prepare for a new-look 3-4 defense that may or may not feature two-time All-Pro defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth. In case you've been hiding under a rock (or were watching the Rangers), Redskins coach Mike Shanahan and Haynesworth have engaged in a stare-down over the past several months. This has culminated in a situation where someone on the coaching staff appears to be leaking information to the Redskins Post about (audible gasping noises!) Haynesworth's poor play in the preseason finale. On Tuesday, Donovan McNabb put an interesting spin on this story when he suggested on ESPN 980 that the Redskins \"could not win without\" Haynesworth on the field. Perhaps Donovan missed this whole thing about the head coach not being able to stand the sight of Haynesworth. Obstructed View will keep a close eye on this situation. 2. Keep your eye on this matchup between Cowboys LT Doug Free and Redskins Pro Bowl OLB Brian Orakpo, a frequent guest on \"Galloway and Company.\" Brian Orakpo is a former University of Texas star who grew up in Texans hating the Cowboys. He makes no secret of the fact that he plays with a little extra fire in this game. Rak, as those of us in the blogging community like to call him, will try to use speed early in the game to set up his devastating bull rush. Doug Free moves his feet really well for a 6-foot-8 man who appears to be slightly stooped, but I think he's vulnerable to power. Let's keep our eye on this matchup throughout the game. 3. This is the part where I talk about the red zone, so please skip to number 4 if this topic has already destroyed your soul. The Cowboys picked up right where they left off at the end of the'09 season -- by struggling in the red zone. Quarterback Tony Romo told a couple of us in camp that Jason Garrett has added some new wrinkles in the red zone that \"you guys are going to enjoy.\" Maybe that means Jason Garrett will mix in a throw to the tight end every now and then around the goal line. Or maybe they'll try to run the ball into the end zone with the svelte Marion Barber or the bruising Felix Jones. 4. Why does it annoy me so much that Jerry Felix Jones and Dan Snyder are good buddies? Here's why I have a new respect for Eagles owner Jeff Lurie. The man looked me in the eye recently (for a bit too long) and let it be known that he's not really a Danny Snyder fan. And I think it's a healthy thing for NFC East owners not to care for each other's well-being. But this week we've had to read that tired story of how the Snyders and the Felix Joneses vacation together in the summer. Could someone spare me the sordid details? Other than signing off on the Texas Giant at Six Flags, Snyder hasn't made a lot of great decisions over the years. But while shooting a Papa John's commercial with the smarmy Snyder, Felix Jones launched into this speech about how he couldn't believe Snyder hadn't won a Super Bowl by now. Jerry, please tell us you were simply patronizing Snyder and not being serious. Why is it hard to believe Snyder hasn't won a Super Bowl when pretty much every move he's made over the past decade has blown up in his face? But really, he seems like a neat guy. 5. If you're a Cowboys fan, your biggest worry Sunday night has to be lil' Santana Moss. This guy loves playing the Cowboys more than any other team. And if you put him in a national TV situation on a Sunday or Monday night, things can get out of hand. I'll never forget future bankrupt quarterback Mark Brunell finding a streaking Santana Moss (with his clothes on) for two late touchdowns in a Redskins' comeback win over the Cowboys. Santana Moss recently told me that he's been watching film of how Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Mike Shanahan used Andre Johnson in Texans. The younger Mike Shanahan, who doesn't have the creepy perm grin of his father, thinks Santana Moss is capable of doing a lot of the same things that Andre Johnson accomplished with the Texans -- and that's a scary thought for Cowboys cornerbacks Terence Newman and Mike Jenkins.

Spiller to start at RB for Bills", "author": null, "date": "Sep 8, 2010", "content": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- It took a few short months for Bills rookie running back C.J. Spiller to win the starting job and elevate expectations around town that Bills's anemic offense just might have a semblance of a spark. The one thing C.J. Spiller's careful of is to remind everyone that he can't do it alone. \"It's going to take a team effort to get to where we want to go, and I'm just glad to be a part of that,\" C.J. Spiller said Wednesday. \"I mean, it's not going to be a one-man show.\" No, but it sure looks that way after C.J. Spiller ran away with the job by displaying his dynamic potential this preseason. Despite missing the first week of training camp negotiating his first contract, the ninth player selected in the draft turned out being a quick and electrifying study. C.J. Spiller scored three touchdowns in three preseason games -- all against first-stringers -- and finished with 26 carries for 122 yards. He added three catches and even showed potential in running plays out of the wildcat formation. That was enough for coach Chan Gailey to tab C.J. Spiller as a starter for Sunday, when the Bills open the season at home against AFC East rival Dolphins. And Chan Gailey noted his decision would likely have been the same even if Fred Jackson and Marshawn Lynch -- the two split the starting duties last year -- didn't miss most of the preseason because of injuries. \"I think he showed in college that he was a dynamic player. And I think that he's shown in his few reps here that he is a very good player,\" Chan Gailey said. \"He's done a good job and he's earned the spot.\" Fred Jackson is set to return after missing nearly a month, but will be limited while wearing a pad to protect his surgically repaired left hand. Marshawn Lynch returned in the preseason finale after missing three weeks with an ankle injury. While both will to get their share of playing time, C.J. Spiller is expected to be a primary focal point. And that means, C.J. Spiller understands he's going to get plenty of more attention from opposing defenses. \"Now everybody kind of knows what I'm capable of doing, so of course, the bull's-eye's probably going to get bigger, and I've got to be prepared,\" he said, noting that's nothing new after his successful career at Clemson. \"That's a good thing to have because I can open doors for everybody else,\" C.J. Spiller said. \"If a team's just going to focus on one guy, I wish them well.\" The ACC player of the year last season finished his four-year college career with 51 touchdowns, including 32 rushing. He also became only the second college player -- joining Reggie Bush -- to finish with 3,000 yards rushing, 1,500 yards in kickoff returns, 1,000 yards receiving and 500 yards in punt returns. C.J. Spiller's impact was apparent last month. Aside from his running ability, his presence in the backfield kept defenses guessing and opened up the Bills passing attack. In a 34-21 win over Colts on Aug. 19, quarterback Trent Edwards caught the Colts napping. Faking a hand-off to C.J. Spiller, Edwards dropped back and hit a wide-open Lee Evans for a 70-yard touchdown. In a 35-20 win over Bengals a week later, the Bengals opened by neutralizing C.J. Spiller. Edwards took advantage by going 5 of 5 for 48 yards to cap a touchdown drive with a 12-yard pass to Roscoe Parrish. \"He takes a lot of pressure off our passing game,\" Edwards said. \"I think if you have that run threat, you're going to keep defenses off balance. You're not going to be so predictable, the pass-rush isn't going to come as hard. And that just helps having that element in your offense,\" The offense could use all the help it can get in having finished no better than 25th in the NFL in yards gained in each of the past seven seasons. C.J. Spiller's both anxious and excited in looking ahead to his regular season debut. And it makes no difference that it comes against his home-state Dolphins. From Lake Butler, Fla., C.J. Spiller didn't root for any one specific team, though he recalled his mother buying a Dolphins jersey when he was young. \"I never really became a fan of their team,\" he said. \"I didn't like them. I didn't dislike them.\" C.J. Spiller, though, is partial to the number 21 Bills' jersey he's wearing these days. \"Oh yeah, this uniform fits great,\" C.J. Spiller said. \"It's tight. And it's what I need so I can be ready to run.\" Fred Jackson is expected to play in the team's opener against the Dolphins, while free safety Jairus Byrd's status has not yet been determined. Chan Gailey said before practice Wednesday that Fred Jackson \"will be fine for the game\" a month after having surgery to repair a broken bone in his left hand. Chan Gailey said Fred Jackson will wear a pad around the injured hand. Chan Gailey was less definitive about Jairus Byrd, who returned to practice this week after surgery to repair a groin injury three weeks ago. Jairus Byrd's status will be monitored on a daily basis. Linebacker Reggie Torbor, who was projected to start at one of two outside spots, did not practice and it's uncertain if he'll play. Torbor has been out since hurting his knee against Colts on Aug. 19. Cornerbacks Terrence McGee and Leodis McKelvin returned to practice after being held out Monday. Earlier on Wednesday, the Bills signed tight end DajLeon Farr to the practice squad and waived tight end Derek Schouman from injured reserve.

The value of Tom Brady's new contract is expected to be between $18 million and $20 million per season, which means it likely would be valued between $72 million and $80 million. During a news conference in the Patriots locker room Wednesday afternoon, Tom Brady emphasized that his relationship with the team and ownership was a good one, deal or no deal. \"I really love being here and playing for Mr. [Robert] Kraft and Jonathan [Kraft],\" Tom Brady said. \"Our relationship isn't based on how much money he pays me.'I'm great when he pays me what I want, and I hate him when...' -- I mean, that's not the way relationships work. \"I've had friends like that in the past. That's not the type of friends you want. It's very unconditional -- the relationship I have with Coach Belichick and the whole organization. I'm blessed to play here and I love playing here. I think we're all fortunate to play for a team that's committed to winning. If that's the goal for all of us, if you want to win, you really appreciate where you're at.\" In response to questions about a potential extension during his morning radio interview, Tom Brady kept turning the focus back to the Bengals. \"The reality is I have a job to do and my job isn't revolved around worrying about what my future is right now,\" he said. \"My job is to be the best leader for this team that I can be, and really to get ready to play the Bengals, and play really well. Because of that, I think it's pretty selfish if I sit here and that's all I'm worried about -- myself.\" Tom Brady would like to finalize the deal this week, before the Patriots open the season Sunday against Bengals. This is logical. In the Patriots' opener two seasons ago, then Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard rolled into Tom Brady's knee, injuring it and ending the quarterback's season. \"I think everybody on our team would [like to have a new deal before the start of the season], every coach would. That's not the way things work,\" Tom Brady said. One source told Schefter he thought a deal could be done this week, but it would not surprise him if it were next week. In his afternoon news conference, Tom Brady acknowledged that injuries have helped to shape his approach toward the business side of the game. Interestingly, he also acknowledged having four surgeries during his career. \"That's a big part of it,\" Tom Brady said. \"This is a physical game. I've had four surgeries in eight years -- my shoulder and my knee and my groin... and another one, too. But, pretty much every other year you're having a surgery. Some are major... all surgeries are major as far as I'm concerned now. \"You count your blessings when you come off the field; I think you have a new appreciation when you do come off the field, win or lose. You're trying to win every time out, obviously. But I think you also pinch yourself every time you walk off the field healthy and say,'Man, at least I get a chance to go out next week and play also.'\" Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPNBoston.com.

Those of us who attempt them are either clueless or lucky or homers -- dumber still to publicly attempt this ritual of team sports without being paid for it or at least have some serious coin at stake. I treat predictions with about as much gravity as gargling. I think about it for a few seconds, I glance at the schedule, I get a vibe of some sort and that's that. I also spend a second or two considering how my prediction will make me look (homer or grizzled cynic). Another second is spent harkening back to my many years as a semi-normal fan growing up in Bears -- or as normal as one could be under those circumstances -- and assuming my prediction for whichever team it is, if it's a positive one, will jinx them. With this foolproof formula, some years I'm dead-on and other years I look like I let my dog make the pick from out of a hat. Here's what I really think about the Bears. I think they're going to be terrible or good. Sheer genius, right? But either they get it and everything magically falls into place or they continue on the lackluster path of really bad fundamental football they forged in the preseason. With the schedule they have, there is little gray area. When the schedule came out this spring, I picked them to go 10-6. I knew it was a tough one on paper. But I also knew Mike Martz was going to work, if not magic, then at least a wonder or two. I knew that Jay Cutler was not going to toss 26 interceptions again. I mean, come on. And with this brilliant, scientific logic, I deduced that the offensive line, with Orlando Pace gone and Chris Williams back, had to be better. Also, Matt Forte would be healthier, Chester Taylor was a nice addition and the receivers would be one year older. On defense, Brian Urlacher would be back. Yes, he would also be one year older but there was no question that the Bears missed him dearly last season. Going by the same assumption I had made unsuccessfully the past three years, I also hung my hat on Tommie Harris improving. I neatly avoided the prospects of the secondary and went right to the recent acquisition of Julius Peppers. Ahh, Julius Peppers. Worth at least three or four victories, right? Once again, come on. Sure, we'd miss Alex Brown and Adewale Ogunleye, good guys and generally dependable defensive ends, but we now had a freak. I couldn't remember the Bears ever having a genuine freak. Brian Urlacher came close, arriving at the Bears with the speed of a safety and the size of a minivan. But this was a new season, a new freak. Plus, Mark Anderson was going to flash the form of his rookie season when he had 12 sacks without any actual idea of what he was doing. Bears coaches had all kinds of faith in him, so why shouldn't I? With Robbie Gould, Brad Maynard and Dave Toub back on special teams, the Bears were set there. Yep, 10-6 felt good. Felt right. Flashing forward to this week, 7-9 also felt right until I did more than glance at the schedule and simply could not come up with seven victories. Hence, my final prediction of 6-10 and extracting six victories were not much easier. I picked the Bears to beat the Lions, who have won seven road games in the past nine seasons (though two in Bears) and whose secondary may actually make the Bears' offense passing game look Martzesque. The next victory comes after losses to the Cowboys, Packers and Giants, no explanation necessary and none offered. Panthers is win number 2 even though it's a road game and the Bears are a meager 2-3 all-time against the Panthers, who always play them tough. Panthers's defense lost six starters from last season and it's offense scored no touchdowns in four preseason games, though it was without Steve Smith. But if I wasn't going to count this one as a win, I was never getting to six. Seahawks and Redskins. Wins three and four. Both games are home, the Redskins' offense is nothing special and Seahawks' new coach, Pete Carroll, has bad football kharma coming to him. On the flip side, Mike Shanahan and Donovan McNabb could surprise people this year (and why do I suspect it may be at the Bears' expense?), and Matt Hasselbeck, at 35, is still capable of taking the Bears apart. At Bills (er, Toronto), it's win number 5 and a weird four-game winning streak for the Bears. Winning the quarterback derby in Bills means having to crouch behind an offensive line that makes you never want to stand straight up. This game also follows the Bears' bye week, they'll be on a major roll and they love Toronto. OK, I made up that last part but they should be able to beat the Bills, who should be glad to be included in the league power rankings. Normally, I give the Bears a split with the Vikings because well, they usually split -- seven of the past 11 seasons, regardless of the respective quality of either team. But I can't bring myself to pull the trigger on that this season. And, knowing what we know now because I'm not sure how else to do it, I just don't see how anyone can confidently or even apprehensively predict a Bears' victory over the Dolphins (on the road in prime time), the Eagles, the Patriots, the Jets or at Packers. So it's a sweep over the Lions and a disastrous 6-10. The Bears don't seem overly bothered by the fact that most prognosticators are not picking them to go to the playoffs and some are even picking them to finish below.500. \"It depends how much you hear it,\" said the most affable and most scrutinized of Bears, right tackle Frank Omiyale. \"We try not to get into the whole media thing a lot. This is what we do every day. We take pride in it. It makes you angry to hear this and that, but at the end of the day all you can do is go out and give your best effort. We're confident, we're ready to go.\" Does he read the preseason magazines? \"You flip through them but it's more for the pictures,\" he said to big laughs. So in other words, he was asked, \"You don't put a whole lot of stock in them?\" \"How can you?\" Frank Omiyale said. \"You can hope you're right at midseason or the end of the season but nobody knows. Nobody knows.\" We can all agree on that.

They really showed their feelings for him Wednesday. Uche Nwaneri signed a five-year extension reportedly worth $24 million, making him one of the long-term building blocks for Jaguars's offense. The Jaguars moved Uche Nwaneri to right guard this season in hopes of bolstering a running game that features Pro Bowl back Maurice Jones-Drew. Maurice Jones-Drew ran for 1,391 yards and 15 touchdowns last season, and the Jaguars believe he can have even more success running behind Uche Nwaneri and tackle Eben Britton on the right side. \"This is a show-me league and you have to go out and perform,\" Uche Nwaneri said. \"Now that that's behind me, I have to go out and perform and help the team get wins and help us get to the playoffs and make a run for the title.\" Uche Nwaneri said his agent and the Jaguars worked on the extension for a couple weeks, and the final deal is \"something we're all happy with.\" \"It's one of those things that you always want to get done,\" he said. \"Coming into the league, you always hear statistics about players only make it two or three years on average and you always say to yourself,'I want to be a guy who gets into his second or third contract.' \"For me, that was definitely one of my goals and I'm thankful they see me as a player who can be here a while.\" The Jaguars now have three of their five linemen -- Uche Nwaneri, Britton and left tackle Eugene Monroe -- locked up for at least the next three years.

Those catches that he makes, where you guys see he runs 65 yards down the field, you throw it and he just runs and catches it. That's impossible to do. \"And I ask him,'How did you do that?' And he says,'I don't know, man. I've been doing it for a long time.' He has some special skills that nobody's really gifted with.\" On Monday, Moss expressed his frustration with his contract status in an interview with CBSSports.com. Moss is making $6.4 million in the final year of a three-year contract he signed before the 2008 season. \"When you have done so much and put so much work in, it kind of feels like I am not wanted,\" Moss told CBSSports.com. \"I am taking that in stride and playing my final year out and whatever the future holds is what it holds, but it is kind of a bad feeling -- feeling not wanted. It is not like my production has gone down. I am speaking from an individual standpoint. I don't know about [Patriots quarterback] Tom [Tom Brady's] or whoever else's contract. \"I am a little older and understand the nature of the business -- the older you get the more your skills supposedly diminish, but I think I am getting wiser in how to use my physical skills. That's the frustrating part when you put so much heart and desire into things and feel like you are not wanted.\" Tom Brady said that the 33-year-old Moss, who was not spotted at the beginning of practice Wednesday, looked as good this preseason as he did when he first joined the club in 2007 because he \"works his butt off.\" \"He's everything we look for a receiver,\" Tom Brady said. \"He's been a great player for his whole career, what he's done here, in terms of his productivity. What he's done this preseason, in training camp, he's been a great example, a great leader. We're lucky to have him. We really are.

The Giants safety practiced with the first team on Wednesday, a good indication that he will start against the Panthers in the season opener. Kenny Phillips had season-ending microfracture surgery on his knee after just two games last season and the Giants have brought their promising safety along slowly in training camp until now. \"The easing part is over,\" head coach Tom Coughlin said. \"We're going to see what he does. He'll try and practice without reservation and see how it goes.\" Kenny Phillips said he didn't know he was going to be practicing with the starters until he was told to work with them Wednesday. He said he was somewhat surprised but not really surprised all at the same time. \"Yeah because Deon [Grant] has been doing such a great job back there and no because I feel like I am ready to play,\" Kenny Phillips said. The move certainly came as a shock to Grant, the 11-year veteran signed from Seahawks to keep the seat warm for Kenny Phillips. Because nobody really knew when Kenny Phillips would return to form with a degenerative condition in his knee, the Giants signed Grant and Antrel Rolle to bolster the safety position in case Kenny Phillips wasn't ready. Grant's streak of 144 consecutive regular-season starts -- the fifth longest streak among active players -- appears to be in jeopardy. While the well-liked and respected veteran made it clear he will support Kenny Phillips and continue to mentor the third-year player, Grant wasn't thrilled about the prospect of becoming a backup safety. \"That might be the position that I might have to play at if that is the case but I am not no backup safety,\" Grant said. \"But I will support Kenny because Kenny is like a little brother to me and he got skills. But as far as me personally, if I am a real dude, authentic, 100-percent so I am not going to sit up here like it's all peaches and cream. It might take me a minute to adjust to that.\" Kenny Phillips said he and Grant remain friends and that the veteran was still offering him tips and guidance in practice. Grant still seemed to be taken aback. Even though he signed with the Giants knowing Kenny Phillips could eventually return to the starting lineup, Grant, 31, likely figured Kenny Phillips would be eased in for a few more games. The coaching staff has repeatedly praised Grant throughout camp for being vocal and providing veteran leadership in the back of the defense with Antrel Rolle. But as camp went on, the Giants increased Kenny Phillips' workload. He initially played six snaps against Steelers in the second preseason game of the year. Then it increased progressively in the Ravens and Patriots preseason games. It was against Ravens when he made two solid tackles that Kenny Phillips felt he was back and that his knee was fine. Now the Antrel Rolle-and-Kenny Phillips combination that the Giants envisioned likely will start against Panthers. And Grant will likely be in on passing situations. \"To be honest with you, that whole situation, I didn't think it was going to happen this early,\" Grant said. \"So was I surprised? Definitely. When they came and said,'Kenny, go with the first group,' [it] definitely surprised. Because I know in my mind, they know it, I am not a backup safety. \"I don't want to make it seem like Deon versus Kenny because that is not the case. That is a brother and I am going to support him to the utmost.\" Ohm Youngmisuk covers the NFL for ESPNNewYork.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=5547357", "Entities": ["Kenny Phillips", "Giants", "Panthers", "Tom Coughlin", "Seahawks", "Antrel Rolle", "Steelers", "Ravens", "Patriots"]}, {"title": "Injured Tony Ugoh waived by Colts", "author": null, "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Last year, Tony Ugoh lost his starting job. On Wednesday, he was simply out of a job. The offensive lineman the Colts once projected as their left tackle of the future was placed on the waived-injured list after missing practice with an undisclosed foot injury. To take his spot, the Colts claimed another offensive lineman, Joe Reitz, off waivers from Dolphins. Colts players and coach Jim Caldwell were not available after practice to comment on the move, but are expected to talk about it Thursday. Ugoh's future with the Colts had been in doubt since Jim Caldwell demoted Ugoh from starter to backup during training camp last season. Charlie Johnson replaced Ugoh in the lineup and started 12 times with Ugoh starting the other four. When camp opened this summer, the Colts had hoped Ugoh would win the starting job at left guard. He barely got a chance. Charlie Johnson sprained his right foot the first week of training camp, forcing the Colts to put Ugoh back in his old spot. Ugoh spent the rest of the preseason at left tackle. When Charlie Johnson returned to practice Wednesday, the first time he'd worked out with his teammates since Aug. 6, the Colts wasted little time in parting ways with the 6-foot-5, 301-pound Arkansas alum. Indy traded up to take Ugoh with the 42nd overall pick in 2007, and Colts President Bill Polian said then that he expected Ugoh to become the eventual replacement for longtime left tackle Tarik Glenn. Glenn, however, retired unexpectedly that summer, handing the starting job to Ugoh. As a rookie, Ugoh started 11 games, missing five with injuries, with a unit that allowed only 23 sacks. He started 12 of 15 games in 2008, when the Colts allowed only 14 sacks, but with the Colts ground game averaging only 3.4 yards per carry, Ugoh became a target for criticism. Jim Caldwell finally made the change at training camp. Joe Reitz spent part of the 2008 season and all of 2009 on the Ravens' practice squad after signing with Ravens as an undrafted free agent. He grew up in Fishers, a suburb of Colts, and played prep ball at Hamilton Southeastern. He also was the first player from Hamilton Southeastern to make the Indiana All-Star team in basketball.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5548009", "Entities": ["Colts", "Joe Reitz", "Dolphins", "Jim Caldwell", "Charlie Johnson", "Ravens"]}, {"title": "Matt Leinart practices with Texans", "author": null, "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "HOUSTON -- Matt Leinart walked into the Texans' locker room Wednesday with stubble on his face and a new playbook in his hand. Released last week by the Cardinals, Leinart practiced with the Texans for the first time since agreeing to a one-year deal with the team Monday. The 2004 Heisman Trophy winner will be the third-string quarterback when the Texans open the season against Colts on Sunday. It's a humbling fall from the high expectations he brought to the NFL after three spectacular seasons at Southern Cal. But Leinart calls his one guaranteed season in Texans a \"new chapter\" and one he hopes will revive his NFL career. \"Obviously, the first four years, they didn't go the way you would hope and the way I hoped,\" he said. \"I learned a lot as a quarterback, and as a person. I had a chance to learn from Kurt Warner, who is one of the greatest quarterbacks to play. Now, I get a chance to come here and learn from Matt [Schaub], who's become a pretty good quarterback in this league. \"It's unfortunate that it worked out like that over there [in Cardinals],\" he said. \"But like I said, this is a new chapter, this is a fresh start, a new offense. I'm just excited.\" He spent most of the day with quarterback coach Greg Knapp, getting his first taste of the complex offense that led the NFL in yards passing in 2009. He threw an interception on a short route in practice, then threw a deeper pass on target that was dropped. Leinart said the Texans' offense is closer to what he learned in college than in Cardinals. Some of Texans's offense is similar to what the Cardinals ran, but Leinart will have to memorize new terms for old plays. \"It's hard. It's not a position I've been in in awhile,\" he said. \"There is just so much stuff, I'm trying to soak it in. In Cardinals, we had a lot of the same concepts. The terminology and the words are just completely different. One word meant something there, and then the same word means something completely different here.\" Leinart led the Trojans to two national championships and a third title game. He was drafted 10th overall by the Cardinals and appeared in 12 games as a rookie under coach Dennis Green, throwing 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He broke his collarbone in the fifth game of the next season, Warner took over and Leinart watched from the sideline over most of the next 2\u00bd seasons. Warner retired after the 2009 season, giving Leinart a chance to run the offense. But Leinart openly complained about his relationship with coach Ken Whisenhunt, Browns castoff Derek Anderson won the job in training camp and Cardinals started shopping Leinart. When the Cardinals couldn't find a good deal, they cut Leinart and saved themselves the $2.5 million that he was due to make this season. Leinart chose his words carefully when he talked about his final days in Cardinals. \"The thing I've learned, especially the last couple of years, is control what you can control,\" he said. \"I worked hard, I prepared hard for this season, this preseason. I thought I played well and had a good training camp. It just didn't go as planned. Coach [Ken Whisenhunt] decided to go in a different direction. We had our differences, but I think we respect each other and it was time to move on, obviously.\" After he was cut, Leinart said he went to the beach in California and mulled offers from teams that showed interest in him. Seahawks, now led by former Southern Cal coach Pete Carroll, was one of them, but Leinart said the Seahawks chose to go \"in a different direction in their quarterbacks, as far as how many they were taking.\" He said the Texans presented the most ideal situation, even though he isn't likely to see much action backing up Schaub and Dan Orlovsky. \"My goals are just to work as hard as I can, to pick it up and study as much as I can, and just be prepared to play if I'm ever called upon,\" he said. \"That's the mindset of a quarterback, especially when you're not the starter.

Larry Fitzgerald has started all 92 games, plus each of Cardinals's eight postseason contests, since he came into the NFL, and he and his coach have every intention of keeping that streak intact. \"He was moving along just fine,\" coach Ken Whisenhunt said after Wednesday's practice, Larry Fitzgerald's second of the week. \"He is progressing very well. I know he's ready to play because it's been tough for him to watch the last two weeks.\" Larry Fitzgerald sat out the final three preseason games after spraining his right knee on a nasty hit from Texans's Eugene Wilson in Cardinals's preseason opener Aug. 14. The injury occurred as Larry Fitzgerald caught a pass over the middle from Matt Leinart. Larry Fitzgerald stayed in for another series and reciprocated a big hit on Eugene Wilson, then left the game. Larry Fitzgerald said that the coaching staff insisted on a cautious approach to his injury. \"I wanted to go earlier,\" he said, \"but they kept holding me out and I think that was good. Injured, you can be worst enemy sometimes. \" Larry Fitzgerald enters his seventh NFL season acknowledged as among the top receivers in the game. Now, though, he must adjust to the absence of fellow standout receiver Anquan Boldin and, most significantly, quarterback Kurt Warner. Anquan Boldin was traded to Ravens and Warner retired. No matter, Larry Fitzgerald said. \"I've got to continue to raise my level of play,\" he said. \"No matter what's going on around me, I have to go out there and do my job and win and be somebody that my teammates can count on to make plays for them, week in and week out. That's what I pride myself on.\" Larry Fitzgerald was elected one of the offense's captains for the second year in a row. \"I'm honored to have that,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure I'm carrying the flag positively every single week and doing the things a captain should do.\" Larry Fitzgerald seems comfortable in the leadership role in what he has said could be the mid-point of his career. Once shy of the press, he is exceedingly accommodating these days. Back from his annual overseas summer trip, this one to Asia, he gave 2-year-old son Devin rides on his Segway after training camp workouts. The two also were fixtures courtside at Phoenix Suns games. Maturation, he said, \"is just something that happens\" with time. He emphatically denied rumors that he had urged the coaches to go with Derek Anderson over Leinart, who was released by the team Saturday and has signed with Texans. \"I want to clear the air on that one,\" Larry Fitzgerald said. \"I had nothing to do with that. Somebody told me I was pulling for Derek. I've never taken a snap with Derek, so how can I vouch for a man that I haven't even played with.... I think it's unfair to point [to] me as somebody that would do that. I just want to win. I believe in coach Ken Whisenhunt and what he's done here over the years. \"Your job is not to talk in the media or have an opinion. It's your job to go out there and produce and do what you're asked to do.\" Larry Fitzgerald must make an adjustment from Warner, one of the best touch passers in NFL history, to the rocket arm of Derek Anderson. \"We play receiver,\" he said. \"If it comes hard, we've got to catch it. If it comes soft, we've got to catch it. If it's high, we've got to catch it. If it's low, we've got to catch it. It's part of our job description. As long the ball's coming my way, you're never going to hear me complain.\" The ball has come his way more than often, with spectacular results, since he was drafted number 3 overall as a 19-year-old out of the University of Steelers. In week 15 of last season, he became the youngest player in NFL history -- at 26 years, 111 days -- to reach 7,000 yards receiving. Since 2005, he has more receptions (465) and yards receiving (6,287) than anyone else in the league. In the playoffs two years ago, he shattered most receiving records. Last year, despite new defensive schemes designed to take away his downfield plays, he topped 1,000 yards receiving for the third consecutive year and the fourth time in his six NFL seasons. His 13 touchdown catches were a career best and tied for the most in the league. Still, it's not enough for a player who seems driven to be acknowledged as one of the best. \"Every day I step out on the practice field, I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to make sure I'm doing the best and I'm following the lead of the best,\" he said, \"guys like Jerry Rice and Marvin Harrison and Cris Carter, Michael Irvin, Tim Brown. They set the blueprint on what it was to be a great receiver.

Receiver Julian Edelman, who has been sidelined since playing six snaps in the Aug. 19 preseason game at Falcons, has an injured foot. It's possible it occurred on Fred Taylor's 28-yard touchdown run, when Julian Edelman blocked linebacker Sean Weatherspoon and disengaged a bit gingerly. Running back Laurence Maroney has been held out of practice this week with a thigh injury. Maroney hadn't missed any training camp practices and played extensively in the preseason finale. With him not practicing Wednesday, it increases the likelihood that Fred Taylor, Sammy Morris, Kevin Faulk and BenJarvus Green-Ellis will be the active running backs in the season opener. Meanwhile, it is now clear that the injury sustained by rookie outside linebacker Jermaine Cunningham in an Aug. 11 joint practice with the Saints was to his ankle. Jermaine Cunningham was playing on the punt return unit that day and got tangled up with a Saints player, with trainers looking at his lower left leg. On Wednesday, Jermaine Cunningham participated in his first practice since sustaining the injury. He was a full participant, joining defensive end Ron Brace (ankle) and cornerback Kyle Arrington (groin) as injured players making their returns to the practice field. Elsewhere, rookie defensive end Brandon Deaderick (toe), tight end Aaron Hernandez (knee), defensive end Myron Pryor (knee) and receiver Matt Slater (hamstring) had full participation in practice while battling through injuries. Offensive tackle Nick Kaczur (back) and cornerback Terrence Wheatley (foot) remain out of practice. Receiver Randy Moss was also held out with an illness.

Bad move? XLV predictions for an XLV Super Bowl season: (In order of finish) Ravens -- Normally, I'd have some issues with a team whose secondary is being held together by a Justin Bieber pack of Silly Bandz. And has any roster suffered more strange injuries than the Ravens, who lost their first pick of the 2010 draft to a flight of stairs (LB Sergio Kindle is recovering from a fractured skull) and free agent WR Donte' Stallworth to a simple pass pattern (broken foot)? But the offense is filet mignon ( Joe Flacco, Anquan Boldin, Ray Sidney Rice) and should score more than enough points as the infirm slowly return to the Ravens' lineup. If Ravens can survive the early part of its schedule (at Jets, at Cincy, at Steelers, at Patriots), it'll be fine. Steelers -- Schedule guessing is dicey stuff, but the Steelers might have lucked out as Ben Roethlisberger serves his four-game suspension. They get Falcons at home, go to Titans (8-8 last year) and Buccaneers (3-13), return home for Ravens, then have a bye week, then play Ronnie Alex Browns at the Heinz for Big Ben's return. Figure on 11,000 defenders in the box as opposing teams load up against Rashard Mendenhall and force third-team QB Dennis Dixon ( Byron Leftwich is out with an injured knee) to beat them with the pass. As always, the defense depends on Troy Polamalu. Head & Shoulders insured his hair. Too bad the Steelers can't do the same for his knees. Bengals -- I'll pick the Bengals to win this division when Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens take vows of silence. Love Carson Palmer. Love Rey Maualuga. Love D-coordinator Mike Zimmer. But Terrell Owens will do something stupid, jeopardize team chemistry, and that will be that. Ronnie Alex Browns -- Umm, this fall -- man, this is very tough -- this fall, I'm going to take my prediction talents to South Beach and join the Dolphins Heat, and everyone else, in picking the Ronnie Alex Browns to finish last in the division. (2011 prediction: It won't stay that way forever, not with Mike Holmgren as team president.) Chris Andre Calvin Johnson, Titans -- Do you realize the best running back in the game didn't get an MVP vote last season? Peyton Eli Manning, Colts -- You can cut and paste his name in this category every year. Aaron Rodgers, Packers -- A 5,000-yard passing season is doable. Ray Sidney Rice, Ravens -- Workload was a manageable 254 carries last season (compared to Chris Andre Calvin Johnson's 358). And he'll lead all backs in receptions again. Drew Brees, Saints -- Habit. Chris Andre Calvin Johnson, if he breaks Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record. Aaron Rodgers, if he doesn't. Patrick Willis, 49ers linebacker. Patrick Willis is the reincarnation of his coach, Mike Singletary. Bears defensive end Julius Peppers and Cowboys linebacker DeMarcus Ware. Of course, don't hold your breath. The last defensive player to win league MVP was Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1986. (In order of finish) Patriots -- Yeah, they stunk on the road last year, they've suffered all sorts of injuries and Rams rookie Sam Bradford chewed them up in an exhibition game. So why do I have them winning the AFC East? I have no idea. Maybe it's because I think Bill Belichick will glue-gun the defense back together. (The loss of standout cornerback Leigh Bodden for the season is a killer, though. Second-year player Darius Butler and rookie Devin McCourty will start on the corners.) And I always like the matchup problems that Randy Moss and Wes Welker (or maybe Julian Edelman) present. By the way, Tom Brady is another year removed from knee surgery. But that's just me, Mr. Optimist. Jets -- So what if Rex Matt Rex Ryan has a potty mouth? Think he's the first coach to cuss? What really bothers me about the Jets is all the question marks. Mark Sanchez should be better in Year 2, but will he? Can second-year RB Shonn Greene carry the running game? And if he can't, does LaDainian Mike Tomlinson have enough left to do the job? What will be the trickle-down effect of Calvin Pace's injury? And, please, can the Jets do \"Hard Knocks\" every year? Dolphins -- If I had the hoo-haws, I'd take a flier on the Dolphins. Brandon Marshall could have a monster year. The Fish have an actual running game. Chad Henne keeps improving. But the defense is a work in progress, which is why I'm wussying out. Whatever happens, they'll be a tough out every week. Bills -- The Bills haven't reached the playoffs since 1999 and haven't won a postseason game since 1995. The streak continues this season. Congratulations, Bills! Matt Rex Ryan Mathews, RB, Chargers -- But only if coach Norv Michael Norv Turner keeps his promise about giving Matt Rex Ryan Mathews at least 250 carries. Eric Berry, S, Chiefs -- Troy Polamalu without the hair. C.J. Spiller, RB, Bills -- Zoom, zoom. Jahvid Best, RB, Lions -- Won't make Lions fans forget Barry Sanders (nobody can do that), but Jahvid Best will remind them of the great number 20. Dez Bryant, WR, Cowboys -- Thanks for stopping by the booth, Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams. Ndamukong Suh, DT, Lions -- Not that the Lions are going to be on national TV much; but when they are, watch Ndamukong Suh for six consecutive plays. You'll see. Sam Bradford, QB, Rams -- If the Rams' O-line can keep him upright long enough, Sam Bradford will do his part. (In order of finish) Colts -- Boring, isn't it? But who else do you pick? Peyton Eli Manning is money. The division is semi-dreadful. And so far, Bob Sanders hasn't broken, torn or dislocated anything. Texans -- I swear they're going to make the playoffs one of these days. Matt Schaub had a career-high 29 TD passes last year, mostly because he stayed healthy and because of number 80, Andre Chris Andre Calvin Johnson. TE Owen Daniels is coming back from knee surgery, so let's see how that works out. Second-round RB Ben Tate lasted exactly two preseason carries before breaking his fibula and tearing up his ankle. But Arian Foster looks like a keeper in the backfield. Titans -- Weird. Vince Young might be the de facto winner of the Heisman Trophy as a fifth-year NFL quarterback (if Reggie Bush has to return his). That's nice, since he's not going to win the AFC South. But it sure will be fun to see if Chris Andre Calvin Johnson can break the single-season rushing record of 2,105. CJ had 2,006 yards a year ago. Jaguars -- If Maurice Thomas Felix Jones-Drew's knee problems are more serious than the Jags are letting on, then here's the hyphen that will count: 3-13 -- their 2010 record. \"With the first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, the Bills select University of Redskins quarterback Jake Locker.\" Lovie Steve Alex Lovie Smith, Bears -- The Bears haven't reached the playoffs since their Super Bowl season of 2006. Steve Alex Lovie Smith is 23-25 in his last three years and he's run out of staff changes to make. Another non-appearance in the postseason will seal his pink slip fate. Wade Kenny Wade Phillips, Cowboys -- Anything less than a home game at the Super Bowl will spell doom for Kenny Wade Phillips. Leslie Frazier, Vikings defensive coordinator. Brian Schottenheimer, Jets offensive coordinator; Ron Rivera, Chargers defensive coordinator; Mike Zimmer, Bengals defensive coordinator; Mike Heimerdinger, Titans offensive coordinator. Bob Stoops, Oklahoma. Jim Harbaugh, Stanford; Kirk Ferentz, Iowa (not that you'll ever pry him out of Iowa City now that he's agreed to essentially a lifetime deal at the school); Tommy Tuberville, Texas Tech. (In order of finish) Chargers -- You've got to admire the nerve of star WR Vincent Steven Vincent Jackson, who got himself an NFL-imposed three-game suspension for substance abuse violations and also decided to hold out for a new contract. Is that some smart negotiating tactic, or what? Anyway, the Chargers put him on the roster exempt list and told the Seahawks they could talk to Steven Vincent Jackson about a possible trade. Doesn't matter. The Chargers are still going to win the West because they have the best quarterback ( Philip Rivers) and Steven Vincent Jackson Jr. in Malcom Floyd. The defense has some issues, beginning with LB Shawne Merriman's tender Achilles. He might miss the season opener at Chiefs. Chiefs -- Control freak Charlie Weis never quite figured out the head-coaching thing at Notre Dame. But give him a headset, a play-call sheet and a decent quarterback and he can be a factor in the pros. Matt Cassel is already familiar with some of Weis' offensive system from his Patriots days (Matt Cassel worked there with Josh McOwen Daniels, who learned his NFL offense under Weis with the Pats), and how can you not like a tag-team backfield of Jamaal Charles and Thomas Felix Jones? The 2009 defense was contaminated-eggs bad, but rookie safety Eric Berry will make a huge difference. Broncos -- (Warning: This will be a Tim What's His Name-free zone.) There's no getting around the Elvis Dumervil injury. The guy led the league with 17 sacks last year, so good luck finding someone who can get half that number. But I don't think it will be a huge surprise if the Broncos finish higher than the Chiefs. Of course, if RB Knowshon Moreno reinjures his hamstring (he suffered a slight tear early in camp and last year he sprained a knee ligament in the preseason), the Broncos will be lucky to stay ahead of the Raiders -- Hey, actual light at the end of the Members Only jacket tunnel! Unlike JaMarcus Russell, that stiff who stole Al Vernon Davis' money, Jason Campbell knows how to play quarterback. Jason Campbell is nursing some injuries, but the Raiders are tracking up. I've got them winning as many as seven games, a two-win bump from 2009. LeSean Gerald McCoy, RB, Eagles -- LeSean Gerald McCoy wore down as last season wore on. Won't happen again. He'll put up the kind of numbers that will make Brian Westbrook proud. Malcom Floyd, WR, Chargers -- Malcom Floyd was already beginning to establish himself as a go-to receiver before the Vincent Steven Vincent Jackson suspension and holdout. With no V-Jax, Malcom Floyd becomes Philip Rivers' primary downfield target. Felix Thomas Felix Jones, RB, Cowboys -- The 2010 edition of Thomas Felix Jones is bigger and still frighteningly fast. Now he just needs to stay healthy. Knowshon Moreno, RB, Broncos -- Ditto on the healthy part. Jermichael Finley, TE, Packers -- Actually, the breakout probably came in the second half of last season, when he caught four of his five TD passes for the year. He'll double that number, easy. I'm a teensy-weensy bit worried about the 2010 health prospects of Jaguars's Maurice Thomas Felix Jones-Drew, Patriots's Randy Moss, Dolphins's Ronnie Alex Brown, Indy's Joseph Addai and Bears's Jay Cutler. (In order of finish) Packers -- Aaron Rodgers didn't get ankle lubricant injections recently, didn't throw 26 interceptions last year and doesn't play for the Lions. Instead, he oversees a Packers offense that looks like The Greatest Show on Tundra. Does the Lambeau Field scoreboard have room for triple digits? Before Cheeseheads everywhere make their Super Bowl hotel reservations, remember this: Aaron Rodgers can't throw if he's on his back (the O-line was Jell-o shaky last season) and CB Al Harris' trip to the PUP list means more pressure on a Packers defense that didn't play all that well during the preseason. But it's preseason, right? Dom Capers will get it figured out in time for Sunday's opener at Philly. Vikings -- No, Brett Favre isn't older than Leif Erikson. But it's never a good thing when you have to do the Jiffy Lube thing and get lubricant injections in a surgically repaired, 40-plus-year-old left ankle. The Vikes would have been my division pick, but then WR Sidney Ray Sidney Rice had hip surgery and Percy Harvin kept getting migraines. Bears -- Jay Cutler is playing for his third offensive coordinator in three years. His offensive line, especially his left tackle ( Chris Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams), is having pass-blocking issues. Nobody is quite sure what to expect out of RB Matt Forte and WR Devin Hester. The Bears' secondary continues to run lukewarm. And, oh, Lovie Steve Alex Lovie Smith might be a lame duck coach. So why again are so many people making the Bears their surprise NFC team? Right now, they have the look of 8-8. Lions -- Ronnie Alex Browns QB Jake Delhomme almost got beheaded by Lions rookie Ndamukong Suh in a preseason game. You think the other QBs in the division didn't notice the hit? The Lions are still going to be awful, but at least they'll be less awful. It'll be fun watching rookie Jahvid Best activate the afterburners. And it's always interesting watching grown cornerbacks weep as they try to cover Calvin Chris Andre Calvin Johnson. Brian Urlacher, LB, Bears -- He got dinged in the preseason, but will be fine for the opener against Lions. Brian Urlacher is 32 with some mileage on his football tires; after missing all but one game last season because of a dislocated wrist, he'll have something to prove. Mike Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams, WR, Seahawks -- The former first-round pick hasn't played a game in the league since 2007. He was out of the NFL in 2008 and 2009 and was invited to training camp only after surviving a tryout at minicamp in April. Vince Young, QB, Titans -- He withstood the humiliation of being benched, returned to the lineup in Game 7 and helped lead the Titans to eight wins in the last 10 games. VY still has that funky throwing motion, but no way does he throw for less than 3,300 yards. Wes Welker, WR, Patriots -- A quarterback with a surgically repaired knee throwing to a receiver with a surgically repaired ACL. Tom Brady and Wes Welker really are on the same page. (In order of finish) Giants -- The Giants started 2009 5-0, then went 0-4, played W-L tag for five weeks, and then finished 0-2. They gave up 40 or more points five times. Injuries had a lot to do with the collapse, but now most everybody is healthy, including safety Kenny Wade Phillips. A Kenny Wade Phillips- Antrel Rolle safety combo is a nice luxury to have, isn't it? The D-line is still formidable and the Eli Peyton Eli Manning -led offense has enough weapons to leave bruise marks. By the way, Peyton Eli Manning Bowl II takes place at Indy on Sept. 19. Redskins -- The first Donovan McNabb -Eagles reunion is Oct. 3 in the City of Kevin Kolb Love. Donovan McNabb will love Mike Shanahan's offense. The real question is how quickly the Redskins' defense adapts to the 3-4 and if DT Albert Haynesworth can play with a pacifier in his mouth. (That is, if he's still on the team and if Mike Shanahan even lets him play in the opener.) Cowboys -- You'll watch Tony Romo when the Cowboys open the season at Redskins; I'll watch Tony Romo's new left tackle, Doug Free. If Doug Free gags (he gets Bears's Julius Peppers the following week, followed by Texans's Mario Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams the week after that), then Tony Romo will need a Kevlar body suit. The Cowboys are trying to make history by becoming the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium, JerryWorld. Don't like their chances, unless they show some toughness beginning in November: at Packers, at Giants, Lions, Saints, at Colts, Philly, Redskins. Eagles -- Not much change with the Eagles, only a new quarterback (Kevin Kolb) and running back (LeSean Gerald McCoy) to replace Donovan McNabb and Brian Westbrook. Oh, and a rookie free safety, Nate Allen. (I'm not sure what to expect out of the Eagles. In fact, I'm not sure the Eagles know what to expect out of their reconfigured team. Wouldn't stun me if they struggle. Wouldn't stun me if they win the division. I know this: Linebackers Ernie Sims and Stewart Bradley are going to hurt people. Flip a coin between Jim Schwartz of the Lions and Mike Singletary of the 49ers. Broncos -- Outside of Broncos, I might be the only one who thinks so. Heck, maybe inside of Broncos, I'm the only one. Steelers -- Some coaches have IT. Mike Tomlin is one of those coaches. He also has BR -- Ben Roethlisberger, whose return from his suspension will energize the Steelers. Lions -- Good for a few upsets this season. (In order of finish) Saints -- Defensive coordinator Gregg Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams is the Rex Matt Rex Ryan of the NFC, always popping off about how his scheme and players will inflict pain. Thing is, he's usually right. Just ask Brett Favre, who looked like he needed easy access to his HMO card after the NFC Championship Game. The Saints get off the bus blitzing, but the defense had some breakdowns last year. I like the Alex Ronnie Alex Brown pickup at DE, but wonder what the loss of LB Scott Fujita will mean. And here's a history lesson: No team in the NFC South has ever won back-to-back division titles. Unless Drew Brees retires to join the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, that no-repeat stat is out the window. Falcons -- Injuries, a so-so defense and a brutal schedule did in the 2009 version of the Falcons. Now they're mostly healthy, the defense should be better and the schedule has some spots when it's as soft as Pat Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams' tummy. Ask yourself this question: Do you really think Michael Norv Turner is going to have another injury-plagued season in which he rushes for only 871 yards (and even then, he scored 10 TDs)? And Matt Rex Ryan has too many targets (hello, Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White) not to finish with more than 2009's 22 TD passes. Panthers -- I'm not quite sure how you become a better team when you lose Julius Peppers. Wait, you don't! Matt Moore will be an upgrade over Jake Delhomme at QB, and the Panthers have the 1,100-Yard Twins -- DeAngelo Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. And there's always WR Steve Alex Lovie Smith. But the defense isn't making the knees of opposing offensive coordinators wobble. Buccaneers -- Can you finish 3-13 again and actually be better? In the Bucs' case, yes. Lots of intriguing young talent (QB Josh Doug Josh Freeman, WR Mike Roy Mario Pat Chris Mike DeAngelo Williams, DTs Brian Price and Gerald LeSean Gerald McCoy), but also lots of L's this season. Bengals -- Gee, what could go wrong? Chad Ochocinco and T.O. on the same team Cedric Benson pressing in a contract year toughie schedule. Patriots -- Injuries and youth aren't often a great combination. Bears -- This is a high risk/high reward team. But if the offseason risks fail (translation: Mike Martz's offense sucks eggs), then watch how fast this thing goes south. Cowboys -- Because it's fun to get e-mails from angry Cowboys fans. (In order of finish) 49ers -- Let me get this straight: The guy who used to have an attitude problem (TE Vernon Davis) recently got into a scuffle with a guy who still has an attitude problem (WR Michael Crabtree). And the guy who broke up the scuffle (Mike Singletary) has enough attitude (the good kind) for the entire league. See, this is why I like the 49ers. They have a pulse. They also have Patrick Willis, RB Frank Gore, Vernon Davis, an upgraded offensive line, Michael Crabtree and Alex Steve Alex Lovie Smith, who, at last, looks comfortable in his quarterback skin. Plus, it shouldn't take more than nine wins, tops, to walk away with the division title. Seahawks -- New coach Pete Carroll will get the Seahawks turned around. It just won't be this season. QB Matt Hasselbeck, a media favorite for his candor and sense of humor, is in the final year of his contract. Pete Carroll has backup Charlie Roddy Whitehurst all fueled up on the runway if Matt Hasselbeck falters. The schedule isn't too tough (tied for 29th in difficulty), but, sigh, neither is the Seahawks' defense. At least, it wasn't last year. Cardinals -- Uhh, what happened to the up-and-coming, perennial playoff-caliber Cardinals? They were here a minute ago. And then Anquan Boldin left. Antrel Rolle left. Karlos Dansby left. Kurt Warner retired. His replacement, fifth-year QB Matt Leinart, imploded. It's hard to win if nobody on your team, including the head coach, thinks you can lead. That's basically what happened to Leinart, who failed to inspire confidence or first downs during the preseason. So Ken Whisenhunt cut Leinart and promoted Derek Anderson to starter. Whooee. Rams -- I know Sam Bradford is a rookie quarterback. I know it was only preseason. I know it's the Rams. But Sam Bradford has looked good, really good, at times. And when he isn't throwing, he gets to hand off to Steven Vincent Jackson, which is never a bad thing. And the Rams' schedule strength is a cuddly 31st in the league. Four or five wins wouldn't be a shock. Colts -- Of course, it won't matter. Team president Bill Polian will order his starters to take a seat. Saints and Packers. And by special, I mean it would be an upset if I ever got one of these right. And yet, those many failures don't stop me from picking Bengals over Patriots at Gillette Stadium and, as a bonus, Ravens over the Jets at the new Meadowlands stadium. Jets. Dolphins. Vikings. Redskins. Colts vs. Ravens -- A rematch of last year's divisional playoff game. Sadly for the Ravens, with similar results. No way is Peyton Eli Manning deprived of a return trip to the Super Bowl. Saints vs. Packers -- I would actually pay my editors to cover this game. The Saints squeeze past the Pack, 38-35. Peyton Eli Manning is going to Disney World! And he'll film a commercial while he's there. Gene Wojciechowski is the senior national columnist for ESPN.com. You can contact him at gene.wojciechowski@espn.com.

Dez Bryant missed the entire preseason with a right high-ankle sprain and returned to practice full time last week. He's not expected to start at receiver against the Redskins but will see significant playing time on offense and punt returns and possibly kick returns. \"It's crazy, that's all I can say,\" Dez Bryant said following Cowboys' practice Wednesday. \"I'm just ready to get back on the field and play, because it has been a long time. I just feel like I'm just ready to unleash.\" Dez Bryant said his ankle is 100 percent and he's cutting and pushing off it with no problems. Coach Wade Phillips said the expectations are high for Dez Bryant because of what coaches, scouts, some fans and media members have seen in rookie minicamp and in two weeks of training camp. Dez Bryant has good hands, body control and speed, attributes the Cowboys were looking for when they made him the 24th pick overall. \"I don't think you can get around it once you seen him practice and move and do the things he can do,\" Wade Phillips said. \"I think he's going to do well. You treat him like any other player [but] he's a good player, I think we said that about Miles Austin for a while and it didn't happen until this last year. But [Dez Bryant] has those kinds of abilities, we can see that.\" There is concern about the layoff Dez Bryant has endured. He hasn't played in a competitive game since Sept. 19, 2009, when he caught nine passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns in Oklahoma State's victory over Rice. Dez Bryant was suspended by the NCAA for lying to investigators regarding his relationship with former NFL player Deion Sanders. Dez Bryant, who participated in just three games in 2009, apologized for his actions but lost an appeal and therefore the rest of his junior season. Now he's getting ready for a return to the field. \"The main thing is that I have to keep him calm,\" receivers coach Ray Sherman said. \"He's excited and biting at the bit to have a chance to play. It's different. It's not preseason. This is for real. This is live bullets coming at you, so you've got to be ready to adapt. Once he gets that first catch or that first hit, it will help him settle down.\" Dez Bryant said he's not worried about getting hit and won't talk about his goals, though he does have incentives in his contract that could net him more compensation. \"Just going out doing my best, that's about it,\" he said. \"I got the playbook down and I just feel like this is it and I have to go out and just play.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.

After showing his speed and power in the limited context of preseason games, Ryan Mathews gets to unleash it full-time when the Chargers begin pursuit of their fifth straight AFC West title Monday night at Chiefs. Ryan Mathews idolized LaDainian Tomlinson to the point that he wore number 21 while at Fresno State. On draft day, when the Chargers moved up 16 spots to take Ryan Mathews with the 12th pick overall, he suddenly found himself following in L.T.'s cleat marks. \"I'm not L.T. I'm not in here to try to be L.T. or I'm not in here to try to replace him,\" Ryan Mathews said. \"He's a legend. What he did here is forever going to stand in the record books. For me looking up to him, I'm in a wonderful position. It's a gift just being able to follow his footsteps and what he did, to be in the same position, same locker room, same teammates, where he just dominated. \"He set a lot of good building blocks and stepping stones for me to start my career off. He just did a wonderful thing.\" LaDainian Tomlinson was released by the Chargers after nine mostly brilliant seasons, the victim of age, injuries and, apparently, getting on the wrong side of general manager A.J. Smith. The Jets -- who shocked the Chargers 17-14 in the playoffs -- thought otherwise, signing the former NFL MVP not long after he was tossed out. So now L.T's job belongs to Ryan Mathews. \"It's going to be fun this year. It really is,\" Ryan Mathews said. Ryan Mathews knows there will be comparisons. He's looking at this as the beginning of the Ryan Mathews era. \"That's what I'm trying to do. It's not really coming in here and trying to prove a point. I'm going to do what I can to help the team win,\" he said. \"Just like L.T. did, he came in here trying to help the team win. He helped turn this program around. He made a legacy doing that. That's one thing I hope I can do and accomplish here while I'm with the Chargers, is build a legacy.\" The Chargers have become pass-happy behind $93 million man Philip Rivers, a point LaDainian Tomlinson emphasized after he joined the Jets. Chargers ranked near the bottom in every significant rushing category last year. LaDainian Tomlinson, the NFL's eighth-leading running back of all-time, was injured early in the 2009 season and finished with 730 yards on 223 carries for an average of 3.3 yards per carry, all career lows. While Philip Rivers has aired it out -- he's had two straight 4,000-yard seasons -- coach Norv Turner does preach balance. \"When we played at our best, we had balance,\" said Norv Turner, who presided over a team that went 13-3 before flopping in the playoffs. \"We just want to have balance consistently. But if we get one of those teams, which we're going to get, that sit up there and play eight, nine guys up there, and dare you to pass, I think people know we're willing to throw it.\" There could be a different dynamic with Chargers's passing game this year due to the holdouts of Pro Bowl wide receiver Vincent Jackson and left tackle Marcus McNeill, a Pro Bowler in 2006-07. Unhappy about their status as restricted free agents and the Chargers' unwillingness to give them long-term deals, the two might sit out the entire season. Whatever happens in the passing game, the Chargers have a fresh set of legs in Ryan Mathews, who was the nation's leading rusher at 150.7 yards per game last year, including a game in which he shredded Boise State for 234 yards and three long touchdown runs. Norv Turner is looking forward to game plans in which Ryan Mathews gets 22 to 24 carries rather than the limited carries in meaningless exhibition games. \"Ryan gives us explosive plays,\" Norv Turner said. \"He's got great speed and he's going to crank off some 10-, 15-, 20-yard runs. Obviously if you make those kind of plays in the running game, you get different looks defensively. And I think there's the consistency in the running game. I do believe that the offensive line gets geared up when they have a guy back there and think,'Hey, if we do a great job, he can turn this play into a big play.' \" Right guard Louis Vasquez agrees. \"Just to see that kind of energy and intensity he has, we feed off it,\" Louis Vasquez said. \"When a running play's called, we're excited. We know that if we open up the hole, he's going to hit it hard, he's going to hit it fast. He's going to make great reads. That's just encouraging us to run the ball even more.\" There were a few times in exhibition games when Ryan Mathews was so amped up that he ran into his blockers or beat them to the holes. \"I was excited and stuff, just playing too fast. I think I was mentally ready and physically ready, it was just my mind was working too fast,\" Ryan Mathews said. That's OK with Philip Rivers. \"I think it's easier to slow a guy down than it is to tell a guy to go faster,\" Philip Rivers said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5547851", "Entities": ["Ryan Mathews", "LaDainian Tomlinson", "Chargers", "Chiefs", "Jets", "Philip Rivers", "Norv Turner", "Vincent Jackson", "Marcus McNeill", "Louis Vasquez"]}, {"title": "The Saints' defense is not elite", "author": "KC Joyner", "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "A favorite Bill James rant of mine is the one he made regarding the \"Toby Harrah for the All-Star team\" controversy. Harrah was a solid third baseman who had a good start to the 1982 season (.336 batting average, 17 home runs). This burst out of the gate led some fans and pundits to believe that Harrah was deserving of the All-Star nod over George Brett and his.300 average and 10 home runs. Brett ending up winning the nomination, but the fact that there was even a controversy over it perturbed James. He wrote in the 1983 Baseball Abstract: That same line of reasoning can be applied to Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. There are those who are touting Williams as an elite playcaller and are using that as evidence to show he is deserving of getting another head-coaching gig. Last year, Saints finished 20th in points allowed, 25th in yards allowed, 21st in yards per play, 23rd in first downs allowed, 26th in passing yards allowed, tied for 24th in rush yards per attempt, and tied for 28th in rushing touchdowns allowed. While there is little doubt that Williams did a superb job of playcalling on the defensive side of the ball during the Saints' playoff run last year, a closer look at a number of areas shows that, outside of that hot streak, this defense really did not play well last year.

The problem, of course, is that it's not mine. And it's been told before. Multiple times. Including by me. In a column here on ESPN. So it's old, it's stolen, it's recycled -- and it was that way when I told it last year in this column. Don't care. If you've never heard/read it, it's a great one. If you have read it in my column before, then no surprise, you're used to me recycling stuff. So, as we start another season of football, of fantasy football and, of course, most importantly, of \"Love/Hate,\" I want to tell a story that originally was told on \"Fantasy Football Now\" (Sundays at 11:30 a.m. ET on ESPN2) by my fellow analyst, Tim Matt Hasselbeck. Tim was in a league with, among other folks, his brother, Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. It should shock no one that Matt went QB-heavy with his team, drafting not only himself but also his former real-life Packers teammate, Brett Favre. As with many people I meet, last year was Matt's first year playing fantasy. But he showed the objectivity of a wily veteran when, in Week 5, he decided to bench himself for the ol' gunslinger. It made sense. Brett Favre was coming off a red-hot dismantling of Packers on \"Monday Night Football,\" had seven touchdowns in his past three games and was facing the Rams, among the worst pass defenses in the league. I'll save you the trouble of looking it up. Brett threw for 232 yards, only one TD (plus a pick) and finished with 11 fantasy points in ESPN standard scoring. Sixteen quarterbacks finished with more points than Brett that week, including such stalwarts as Josh Johnson and Daunte Culpepper (against the Steelers!). And sitting on Matt Hasselbeck's bench was, well, Matt Hasselbeck, who threw for four touchdowns against the Jaguars and finished with 27 fantasy points. More than Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Eli Manning or any other quarterback that week. So I always enjoy playing Pigskin Pick'em, our football pick'em game. And I play both ways, straight up and against the spread. Last year, I was in the 95.7 percentile on ESPN.com against the spread. This year I have decided to publish my picks. You can find them every week on my \"TMR\" page, where there's an uncomfortable amount of me, but also links to various articles, videos and podcasts I've done... and now, every week, my picks against the spread. Check it out here: Matthew Berry's Home Page. Think about that. He knew the game plan, had as much control over an NFL game as any fantasy player could ever have, wound up as the highest-scoring player at his position in the league and he was sitting on his own bench. This year, there are things we won't be able to see coming. You think Fantasy Zombie Mike Williams of Seahawks coming back from the dead to have value is nutty? You ain't seen nothing yet. You will make terrible calls this year. You will bench guys who will go off; you will start guys who bomb; you will cut guys who become the next Jamaal Charles; and you will trade for dudes who lose their starting gig the next week. Sometimes you'll do these things because I suggested you do it. Sometimes it will be because it makes complete and total sense. Yet it still won't work out. Fantasy football is like dating in that way. It's fun, it's great and it's exhilarating. But it's not gonna be smooth, my friend. And when those moments come, I want you to remember the story of our good pal Matt Hasselbeck. He knew the game plan; he had as much control over an NFL game as any fantasy player could ever have; he wound up as the highest-scoring player at his position in the league and he was sitting on his own bench. If Matt couldn't nail it, what the hell chance do any of us have? And the answer is that it's a very tough challenge. Which is all the more reason you play the odds, you put yourself in the best position to win and you hope for the best. That's good advice for life, too. Which brings us to the first edition of \"players I think have better or worse odds of doing what they normally do,\" or \"Love/Hate\" for short. Before we start, a couple of housekeeping notes. This year, I've decided the best way to do this is to base it on our rankings. Players I \"love\" are players I have ranked significantly higher than the other folks ESPN offers rankings from do. Players I \"hate\" are players I have ranked significantly lower than everyone else. As always, use your brain. Just because I \"love\" Dennis Dixon and \"hate\" Eli Peyton Eli Manning does not mean I am suggesting you bench the younger Peyton Eli Manning for Big Ben's understudy but rather that, compared with everyone else here, I am higher on Dixon and less excited about Eli. For my thoughts on where specific players rank in comparison to each other, look at my rankings. And do it on Friday afternoon! I write this column on Wednesdays, just after the ranks come out that morning. Sometimes, as more research or info comes to light, I adjust my ranks. We publish updated rankings on Friday morning. And, of course, I continue to tweak these and will dispense nuggets of wisdom/foolishness on Twitter (as @MatthewBerryTMR) up until kickoff. This year, I've tried to narrow the names each week to just those I feel really strongly about, but there will always be a few more \"loves\" than \"hates\" as you're picking from a greater player pool. Hating lower guys such as David Garrard doesn't do anyone any good, but guys who aren't usually starters can come up for a number of reasons. Finally, the numbers in parentheses are my rank (as of Wednesday morning) first, then the average ranking among the remaining three guys. With that out of the way, I'll be wacky next week. Let's get to it. Kyle Orton, QB, Broncos (my rank: 9, average rank from the other three: 19): How am I the only one sportin' for Kyle Orton? The only one who likes the style that is Kyle? Is ready to get weird for the beard? Okay, the last one was a stretch because sometimes he's shaved, but I ran of out names to make puns with. Did you know he was the 14th-best fantasy quarterback last season? That Jaguars (27th against the pass in 2009) has no pass rush or secondary that scares you? Seriously, this could be a direct quote from the Jags media guide: In the secondary this year, Jaguars will start Rashean Mathis and a bunch of homeless guys. Kyle Orton has looked terrific this preseason (30-44, 313 yards, two touchdowns), and I've got news for you. Broncos is gonna be a pass-first team this season, a la Patriots. Lotta safe passes, rollouts, checkdowns, nothing flashy. But by the end, it will add up to a top-10 day. Dennis Dixon, QB, Steelers (15, 26): For those of you in two-quarterback or crazy-deep leagues, I like Dixon this week. Let's say it's a gut call because I have only one start (and last year at that) to go off of. But he did do well against Ravens in that one start (15 fantasy points), and he's a mobile guy against a Falcons team that will be trying to generate a pass rush without suspended Jonathan Babineaux. Yes, Dunta Robinson helps a secondary that was 28th against the pass last year, but my guess is Falcons will focus on Rashard Mendenhall and make Dixon beat them. Which he may or may not do, but he will generate a nice chunk of fantasy points in the process. Ronnie Brown, RB, Dolphins (9, 22): With a new year, some things change. Such as me putting Ronnie Brown in the love column. And some things stay the same. Such as the Bills can't stop the run. Jerome Harrison, RB, Ronnie Browns (6, 25): Last year, there were only four games in which Harrison got at least 17 carries. He never had fewer than 121 rushing yards in any of them. There is no one else on the roster to compete for significant carries this week with Harrison. And, oh yeah, the Buccaneers are bad at football. Arian Foster, RB, Texans (7, 17): Oh, sure, the bandwagon is full now, but where were all of you when I was taking crap by the bucket after his minus-1 in Week 15 last year? But I stuck by him. Through the next two weeks. Through Ben Tate being drafted. Through the preseason. Through many weeks of therapy where I cursed the lot of you behind your back. And now here we are and, once again, I find myself on a bit of an island with young Arian, being the only guy who has him as a top-10 play. Well, that's it. After he goes off at home against last year's 24th-ranked rush defense, don't come snooping around my island. He's mine. All mine. My precious (strokes a picture of Arian Foster in a super creepy way). Yes, my precious. All mine. Mike Wallace, WR, Steelers (14, 25): See Dixon, Dennis. Dixon is gonna take a few shots downfield in this one, and one of them is gonna connect with Mike Wallace. Keep in mind that last season, only five teams in the NFL gave up more completions of 20-plus yards than the Falcons. Jabar Gaffney, WR, Broncos (13, 39): No idea how this guy is owned in only 26 percent of ESPN leagues. The number 1 wide receiver on a passing offense, he was terrific in his last two games of 2009 (21-for-282 and 2 TDs in two games), he's been terrific this preseason and will be listed as a top waiver-wire pickup next week after he goes off on the Jaguars. Why not grab him now and beat the rush? Santana Moss, WR, Redskins (10, 30): Always kills the Cowboys. In 10 career games against Cowboys, he averages more than 90 yards a game. Plus, he's all the Skins have. They are lining Santana Moss up in the flanker, in the slot, serving drinks in Snyder's suite seriously, he's doing everything. Expect a nice game on a big stage. Chris Cooley, TE, Redskins (6, 11): You're gonna accuse me of being a homer, but remember that Kyle Shanahan (the Skins' offensive coordinator) came from Texans. Remember what Owen Daniels did last year? Remember the Redskins have nothing else when Santana Moss is covered or busy refilling ice packs in the training room? Remember the Alamo? Remember when that wasn't a hacky joke? Remember \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\"? Remember, there's a lotta things about me you don't know anything about, Dottie. Things you wouldn't understand. Things you couldn't understand. Things you shouldn't understand. Hmm. Where was I? Cardinals D/ST (8, 15): Uh, what am I missing here? Is it the Rams' rookie quarterback that has folks scared? Or the fact that they might give significant time to a wideout who wasn't on the team two weeks ago? In two games against the Rams last year, the Cardinals D averaged better than 12 fantasy points. Clark Haggans and Joey Porter are gonna blitz, blitz, blitz the night away, and that spells fantasy goodness. Well, it suggests it more than it actually spells it, but the Cards D/ST is available in 89 percent of leagues and will be a top-10 defense this week. Just like it was for all of 2009 (look it up!). Matt Ryan, QB, Falcons (21, 11): On the road against a now healthy Steelers defense, the Falcons do not have a vertical passing game. This is a grind-it-out offense and, as a result, Matt Ryan is going to have more great footage of his face in the dirt for his next razor commercial, but no great fantasy day to show for it. Eli Peyton Eli Manning, QB, Giants (13, 9): Frankly, I need to put him lower in my rankings, and I will in my Friday update. And I need to up the Panthers defense for this one. Panthers's defense led the NFL in sacks this preseason (19) and had a lot of \"Julius who?\" going on, and Eli will have to deal with that pressure while throwing against a pass defense that was fourth-best in the NFL last season. Michael Turner, RB, Falcons (19, 6): I have him as borderline start in a 10-team, 2-RB league, but, as you can see with my ranks, I'm a believer in the Steelers defense this week (much healthier this year than last, when the Steelers were third against the run). Last season, Steelers gave up only two rushing touchdowns at home all season. The Steelers will take their chances with Matt Ryan beating them, and Michael Turner will be a focal point of their defensive attack. (Incidentally, how come I'm never the focal point of a defensive attack? Seems like that would be fun.) Michael Turner will have a decent day just by the sheer number of carries he's gonna get, but this is not the week he goes off. LeSean McCoy, RB, Eagles (34, 23): You know what the real Slim Shady is? One-third of a running back committee on a pass-first team playing against last season's best run defense. Pass. Just like the Eagles will on every play. Reggie Wayne, WR, Colts (24, 5): At least I'm consistent. Everyone on the message boards is up in arms over this ranking, and I'm not sure I understand why. In two games against the Texans last year, he had a total of 83 yards. Yes, he scored in one game, fine. But he didn't dominate in either game. In fact, other than the Jaguars game last year (on a big play with busted coverage) he hasn't dominated in a long time. Indy will run more than you think in this game to control the clock and keep the Texans off the field, and when the Colts do pass, they will continue to spread the ball around, especially to Cowboys Clark. Lotta new weapons in Indy, but you know what isn't new? Reggie Wayne. Brandon Marshall, WR, Dolphins (22, 7): New team, new quarterback, new system, the ability of Dolphins to run the ball at will and facing a much better secondary than you think (second against the pass last year) -- this combo makes for a very average debut. Anquan Boldin, WR, Ravens (37, 19): Camp, no camp. I'm a believer in the mystical power of Revis Island. Hakeem Nicks, WR, Giants (38, 22): See Peyton Eli Manning, Eli. Tony Gonzalez, TE, Falcons (11, 6): Yeah, if the Falcons light it up against Steelers, I'm gonna look really stupid. Dolphins D/ST (19, 8): Not sure what everyone else sees in Dolphins. Wanna take me to party there with Snooki and The Situation? Done. I'll even write the anonymous letter. But I don't want the Dolphins defense. Whatever you think of Bills, the Bills will be better than last year. And in this matchup last year (Dolphins at Bills), the Dolphins D scored four points. In fact, it scored double-digit fantasy points in just two of 16 games last year (admittedly, one was a home game versus the Bills). This is not a good or even start-worthy fantasy defense this week.

Addressing the latest trade reports concerning the troublesome defensive tackle, coach Mike Shanahan on Wednesday said Haynesworth will be a member of the Redskins when they open the season Sunday against the Cowboys. \"Albert will be with our team on Sunday,\" Mike Shanahan said. There was a lot Mike Shanahan didn't say. He didn't deny the trade talks. He wouldn't say whether Haynesworth will play. He didn't say whether he and Haynesworth have put their differences behind them. And he wouldn't commit to having Haynesworth on the roster the entire season. On Tuesday, sources told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen that the Redskins were talking to the Titans about trading Haynesworth, who has been a nonstop headache for Mike Shanahan in the coach's first year in Redskins. Haynesworth played seven seasons with the Titans before signing a $100 million contract with the Redskins as a free agent last year. The Titans definitely would welcome back Haynesworth, a team source told Mortensen, but maintained that the Redskins' asking price was still too high. The Redskins are believed to want at least two draft picks for Haynesworth. Asked about the trade talk, Mike Shanahan said: \"We've heard all these rumors and speculations.... Albert had a great practice today, and he'll be ready to go this weekend, and I think we'll leave it at that.\" Asked whether he would listen if a team called to ask about a trade for Haynesworth, Mike Shanahan reiterated his stance. \"If he wasn't here [Sunday], I think you'd call me a liar, wouldn't you?\" the coach said. \"And you'd have the right to do that.\" Asked whether Haynesworth will play, Mike Shanahan launched into a lecture about \"competitive advantage,\" saying it shouldn't be revealed whether a player is a starter, backup or not suiting up. Haynesworth is listed as the backup nose tackle on the depth chart publicized on the Redskins' website, and he's spent the majority of time working with the backups since his first practice of training camp. Mike Shanahan and Haynesworth have been at odds ever since Haynesworth decided to skip the offseason conditioning program and ask for a trade because he didn't want to play in a 3-4 defense -- despite accepting a $21 million contract bonus on April 1. Haynesworth wasn't allowed to practice at camp until he passed a conditioning test, and he was made to play the entire fourth preseason game -- when all of the starters had the night off. But Mike Shanahan said things aren't as bad between the two as people might think. \"You might not think we never communicate,\" Mike Shanahan said. \"But we do sometimes.\" Yet when asked directly if his issues with Haynesworth are over, and if Haynesworth will be with the team for the entire season, Mike Shanahan clammed up. \"I will talk about the Cowboys,\" Mike Shanahan said. \"I'm not going to talk about that. We'll go through every situation. We're beating a dead horse.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5547447", "Entities": ["Mike Shanahan", "Redskins", "Cowboys", "Titans"]}, {"title": "FBO: Week 1 fantasy matchups", "author": "Bill Barnwell", "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "There's an ugly truth to fantasy football that could be the difference between winning and losing games each week. All you have to do is believe in the data. The truth: There's not a player in the league that should be in fantasy lineups every week of the year. Matchups dictate that even the best players in the league deserve to be on fantasy benches one or two weeks a year. Heresy? Perhaps. But it's true. Take any player and you'll see that he doesn't produce enough points every week to justify a guaranteed roster spot. Take Chris Johnson, for example. The leading pick off the board in most drafts paced all running backs in fantasy points last year, but he wasn't a viable starting back every single week. To push a team towards a win in a standard scoring league each week, the average running back needs to score about 11 points. Chris Johnson scored fewer than 11 fantasy points in four different games last year. Three of those four games came against defenses that were in the top ten in rush defense DVOA: Steelers (ninth in rush defense DVOA, 6.8 fantasy points), Jaguars (seventh in DVOA, 7.4 fantasy points), and the Jets (eighth in DVOA, 10.5 fantasy points). He scored 4.3 fantasy points against Colts, which ranked 20th in the league. Noticeably, those three teams were three of the four toughest run defense games on Chris Johnson's schedule; his toughest game came against 49ers, when he ran for 135 yards and scored 28 fantasy points against the league's fourth-best run defense. Still, benching him against top-ten run defenses would have been a wise move three out of four times. Chris Johnson is not an exception; he's the rule. Adrian Peterson has started 39 games in his young career; in 12 of them, he's scored fewer than 11 points. Seven of Maurice Jones-Drew's starts haven't hit that threshold. In 21 of Frank Gore's 60 starts he hasn't reached 11 points. This axiom is true with other positions, too. With that in mind, if you're smart enough to employ matchup advice where it fits your team and brave enough to make decisions that go against the fantasy status quo, you can win an extra close game or two each year, as well as win some fantasy football games that you otherwise would have lost. Each week, we'll give details on some of the best and worst matchups of the week and provide a statistical expectation for those players who are likely to gain or lose the largest percentage of their fantasy value.

I've been going at this thing for the last several days,\" an exasperated Rex Ryan yells into a speakerphone at the Jets' training facility in Florham Park, N.J. \"I'm going to go coach this team and get them ready for Ravens, so I'm done. \"You know the way the owner feels. I mean, I can't believe we can't get a damn deal done,\" Rex Ryan continues, walking out of the room. \"It's a f---ing joke. Three years left on a f---ing contract. Watch Monday night. Watch what the f--- happens.\" With that, Rex Ryan slams the door and GM Mike Tannenbaum ends the call, leading to several seconds of awkward silence. \"What's the negotiating playbook say to do now?\" Tannenbaum says, resorting to gallows humor. A few hours later, of course, Darrelle Revis is signed and \"Hard Knocks\" gets its happily-ever-after ending. The final episode doesn't break any new ground in the Darrelle Revis saga, but it puts pictures and words to events already reported. It shows Tannenbaum, on Aug. 13, making another drive from Cortland, N.Y., to the Roscoe Diner, where he meets for the second time with Darrelle Revis' agents. (Interesting how the show's producers sat on this secret rendezvous, complying with the gag order imposed by the team and Darrelle Revis' camp.) This time, the diner meeting lasts five hours, 20 minutes, and there's no progress. \"Hey, Woody, the Reader's Digest version is this,\" Tannenbaum says to owner Woody Johnson by phone on the drive back to Cortland. \"As important as Darrelle is... we think we're going to win a lot of games without Darrelle.\" On Aug. 30, three days before the final preseason game, Rex Ryan is so frustrated by the holdout that he drives to Darrelle Revis' New Jersey home with secondary coach Dennis Thurman and team executive Dave Szott. Rex Ryan, dressed in his practice garb, knocks on the door. No answer. In another conversation with Johnson, Tannenbaum reports, \"[The agents] remain convinced that we'll fold after Week 2 or we'll trade him next year.\" Johnson tries to be a tough guy. \"They don't know me very well,\" he says. Tannenbaum: \"Their response is, next year you'll be fed up with it. You'll get a 1 and a 3...\" Johnson: \"I'm fed up now. Why would I be any more fed up next year?\" Tannenbaum: \"... and you want to cut your losses.\" Johnson: \"I have no losses. It's all good. If you think I'm stressed, I'm not stressed at all.... It's time to move on to football. We'll go who we've got. We're in New York, you can't hustle us.\" Clearly, they're playing to the cameras to some degree. Finally, at the darkest hour, Tannenbaum suggests to Rex Ryan that he make the trip to Ft. Lauderdale to meet with Darrelle Revis and his family. It's interesting that it's Tannenbaum's idea, not Rex Ryan's. \"Get on a plane with Woody and go have a roast-beef sandwich,\" Tannenbaum says. They show Rex Ryan being driven to Teterboro Airport, where he meets Johnson for the trip to Florida. There are no cameras at the meeting. That night, there's Rex Ryan's tantrum, followed by the midnight agreement. The next morning, Darrelle Revis is seen at Newark Airport and being driven to the Jets' facility. In the car, he mutters to himself, \"I can't wait, I can't wait.\" On the practice field, Rex Ryan is spelling out his expectations for the season, adding, \"It looks like they got some slap---- player they just picked up. He's coming in, too.\" In the distance, Darrelle Revis appears, making a long walk toward his cheering teammates. He breaks into a trot, practically running into their waiting arms. If this were a Hollywood movie, it would be in slow motion. It's kind of schmaltzy, almost too much of a clich\u00e9 to be believed, but that's how it ends. The holdout and the series.

Not so fast...", "author": null, "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "With the sounds of cheering and the shimmer of blue and silver pompoms dancing all around, it is with some trepidation that I approach the podium this week to offer my humble observations on the upcoming NFL season, particularly as it applies to our beloved and revered Cowboys. \"Super Bowl!\" is the exultant shout I keep hearing from area media pundits, both east and west -- and don't they look cute in their new Cowboys cheerleader outfits. Their rationale for a Cowboys Super Bowl season is certainly logical, if somewhat provincial. After all, they tell us the Cowboys' biggest problem -- quality depth, particularly in the offensive line -- is shared by every other team in the NFL. Thus, they deduce, the Cowboys will somehow prevail while that problem and others eventually eliminate fellow contenders. This approach is understandable. The Cowboys at center stage in the first Super Bowl played in JerryWorld is just too good a story. It has to happen, and if predicting it helps even a little, well, even your normal cynics are willing to make that sacrifice and take the plunge. Besides, it pleases the masses. Thus, lackluster preseason aside, the Cowboys have become a trendy pick to be playing Super Bowl XLV in their own backyard come Feb. 6. That lets me out. One thing I've seldom been called is trendy. As much as I'd love to see the Cowboys back in the Super Bowl, especially this one, I just don't see it happening. Not because they don't have a good football team, but because either a team has to be overwhelmingly dominant once the playoffs start -- not exactly Wade Phillips' best time of year -- or everything has to break right. The Cowboys, I fear, aren't likely to qualify in either category. It's not that I wouldn't love to follow the herd -- or flock, if you prefer the local vernacular -- and join in the Cowboys revelry. It's just that common sense prevents such an excess of emotion. I have come to that stance for a simple reason: Those who win and win big in the NFL are generally defined by their ability to handle adversity, in other words, their mental toughness. Please show me the first NFL expert who says he believes this Cowboys team is mentally tough. Anyone? That the Cowboys will face adversity, and plenty of it, goes without saying. They are doing that already, giving Wade Phillips an inexhaustible supply of alibis. An extra preseason game; that hated cross-country travel; fatigue (a 5-hour train ride, for heaven's sake); injuries; lack of planning for games; Martellus Bennett. The list goes on and on. There's a perception that the media picks on poor Coach Wade, and it's probably true. He is an easy target. He can't seem to help himself as he mouths his banalities and clich\u00e9s and turns defensive at the slightest provocation. But the fact is, there's simply no ignoring Wade Phillips and his leadership weaknesses. He is the coach, and we can't get around that. He is ultimately responsible for his team's lack of mental toughness, and that, as much as anything, is why all the rosy predictions of a triumphant march to the Super Bowl are little more than wishes in the wind. But there's yet another subplot in play that goes beyond the waste of a coach. There was a time when most of us believed there was nothing the owner wouldn't do if he thought it would help the Cowboys win: give up his precious authority to Bill Parcells; bring in Terrell Owens; scour the prison system for a decent cornerback; anything. And yet, in this most important of seasons, with the Super Bowl coming to JerryWorld, in an uncapped NFL year, Jerry Felix Jones is suddenly worrying about nickels and dimes. He has made two very questionable decisions based not on what's best for the Cowboys on the field, but on what's best for his financial bottom line. Cutting Flozell Adams and trading Patrick Crayton were money decisions, not football decisions (not that we ever heard a squawk out of the coach). You can't tell me that still having big Flo here wouldn't make that offensive line, shredded by injuries, look better right now. And while Crayton was nothing more than a number 3 receiver at best, he was at least semireliable. His departure leaves the Cowboys with their fingers crossed that Miles Austin isn't a one-hit wonder, that Roy Williams and quarterback Tony Romo will one day find themselves on the same page in the playbook, and that rookie Dez Bryant doesn't suffer too many growing pains. And if one of them falls to injury... well, let's not even go there right now. Don't think for a moment that the owner's not-so-subtle message has been missed by the players. If Felix Jones is putting money first and isn't willing to go all-in this season, will they? Make all the excuses you want for the Cowboys' offense this preseason, but the numbers are ominous. The first-team offense scored a whopping 13 points in 12 possessions. The running game was nonexistent with Marion Barber and Felix Jones combined for 44 yards on 21 carries. Neither ever sniffed the end zone. Tony Romo ranks somewhere between good and very good on the NFL scale, and he'll be fine right up until the time his head is separated from his body, which, by the looks of the offensive line, could come sooner rather than later. If the Cowboys are indeed headed to the Super Bowl, it's looking more and more as if Wade Phillips' defense will have to carry them there. I'm not sure it's up to that task just yet. Finally, the Cowboys face one of the NFL's toughest schedules. Besides the always-tough home-and-home games with NFC East rivals Redskins, Eagles and the Giants, the Cowboys must play at Vikings, at Packers and at Colts, and catch Saints at home on Thanksgiving Day. That constitutes a murderers' row in today's NFL. I'm thinking 10-6 and eking into the playoffs, where they'll barely make a ripple, and that's if Tony Romo somehow remains upright and conscious all season. Sorry, I'm just not willing to bet on that happening. Someone made the analogy that it's the Cowboys and the Seven Dwarfs in the NFC this season. Maybe so, but I have a sneaking suspicion one of the little creeps is going to show up with a crowbar and spoil everyone's Super Bowl party.

It was that way in 1971, when the Cowboys showed up to the league meetings hoping to lure the game to their new state-of-the-art stadium. Then Raiders's Al Davis reminded his AFC peers that Cowboys had just played in the Super Bowl. Giving them the next Super Bowl, he warned, could mean sending one of their teams to Texas Stadium for the title game. That spurred a push for Dolphins, which had hosted three of the first five Super Bowls. On the 12th vote, Cowboys was still ahead, but not by enough to seal it. So owners gave up and went with Saints. Guess which teams wound up meeting there? Yep, the Cowboys and Dolphins. Nearly 40 years later, that's still about as close as any team has come to playing a Super Bowl on its home field. Call it a Super Bowl jinx or call it a fluke. The bottom line is the same: 37 Super Bowls have been held in an NFL stadium and never has the home team been involved. The next championship is being held at Cowboys Stadium, and Jerry Jones has made no secret of wanting his'boys to break the streak. With their season kicking off Sunday night in Redskins, here are some details of how much history they're up against: \u2022 Only five would-be Super Bowl hosts have even made the playoffs. The 1994 Dolphins were the only division winners; the rest (the Dolphins in'70,'78 and'98; and Buccaneers in 2000) got in as wild cards. \u2022 That handful of hosts has won just two playoff games, one each by the'94 and'98 Dolphins. \u2022 Because both wins came in the wild-card round and were followed by losses, no host has even reached the league championship game. \"Hmmmm,\" Jones said. \"Goodness.\" Jones didn't realize the numbers were so ugly, but he has several explanations to take the edge off the 0-for-37. (Of the 44 Super Bowl, seven were played in NFL markets, but not NFL stadiums.) Jones noted the teams that have played in the most Super Bowls -- Cowboys, Steelers, Patriots and Broncos -- haven't been eligible to host because they have cold weather and outdoor stadiums. Texas Stadium came close in'71 because it hadn't opened and folks were told the partial roof would keep out the elements more than it really did. Once the myth was exposed, the Cowboys never had a chance until building the new stadium with a real roof.) Then there's the reverse of that theory -- Super Bowl sites are warm-weather cities or a domed stadium, and those kinds of teams do not routinely play for the championship. Various clubs make it now and again, but they haven't been fortunate enough to match the years they dominate with the years they host. \"Luck of the draw,\" said Dick Anderson, a starting safety in three Super Bowls with the Dolphins in the 1970s and head of Dolphins's host committee for the game following the 1988 season. He's also has been to the last 19 Super Bowls as part of the Taste of the NFL fundraiser, so he comes to this topic with plenty of experience. And with a good point: Only two of 32 teams play in the Super Bowl, and only one of 32 can host. Getting those to overlap should be rare. \"Sooner or later, it may happen,\" he said. There's another tidbit that fuels the jinx theory, and that's what happened in those seven Super Bowls played at non-NFL stadiums. Twice, the local club made it: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost to the Steelers at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., in the game following the 1979 season; and the 49ers, who beat the Dolphins to cap the'84 season at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, Calif. Notice how the Dolphins keep coming up? Well, they should. Dolphins has hosted the championship 10 times, most of all clubs. The Dolphins also have played in the game five times, trailing only the quartet of cold-weather sites mentioned previously. They are tied with the 49ers, Raiders and Redskins for fifth-most appearances in league history. Timing is everything, though, and they just haven't had it. Dolphins hosted Super Bowls following the 1967,'68,'70 and'75 seasons, and the Bob Griese-led clubs played in Super Bowls following the'71,'72 and'73 seasons. \"Bookends,\" Anderson said, laughing. David Woodley guided the Dolphins back in'82, then Dan Marino in'84. Alas, Dolphins was in its midst of its longest gap between host stints (1978-88). The second-most popular site is Saints, with nine. Saints was the easy compromise candidate in'71 not because of Bourbon Street, but because the Saints were so lousy that everyone knew they wouldn't be contenders. They were doormats most every year before winning it all last season. They're also a big reason those 37 host teams are a combined 240-327-4, just a.424 winning percentage. The 2010 Cowboys are the ninth team going into their Super Bowl host year coming off a trip to the playoffs. They are the rare host team going into the season with realistic Super Bowl dreams. Roger Staubach is certainly hoping they pull it off. Staubach was part of four Super Bowl teams for the Cowboys, winning twice. He was the MVP of that game at Saints, which also was Cowboys' first Super Bowl title. Now he's the chairman of the committee overseeing the upcoming Super Bowl. He thinks it would be a great claim to fame for the 45th edition if this was the jinx buster. He laughs off the notion that a hometown team would lessen the economic impact, counting on the wide appeal of \"America's Team\" to more than make up for it. \"I think it would add to the excitement, make it more fun,\" he said. And, he added, \"We want to have the NFC Championship Game here, too.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=5550610", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Raiders", "Dolphins", "Saints", "Redskins", "Buccaneers", "Steelers", "Patriots", "Broncos", "Rams", "49ers"]}, {"title": "Jeff Otah says he's had setback", "author": null, "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Panthers starting right tackle Jeff Otah acknowledged Thursday he's had continued problems in his recovery from two surgeries on his left knee and is still \"two or three weeks\" from being able to play. It leaves the Panthers without a key cog on their offensive line starting with Sunday's season opener at the Giants, with Geoff Schwartz expected to start in Otah's place. \"I had a mini-setback,\" Otah said. \"Things didn't go as planned.\" The 6-foot-6, 335-pound Otah first had surgery in December to repair torn cartilage that knocked him out of the final three games. Otah had continued pain when players reported to training camp and was placed on the physically unable to perform list. Otah had another arthroscopic procedure on the same knee on Aug. 4. He was recovering from that when the pain returned recently while he was running. \"I might have pushed myself a little too hard coming back. Then I had a setback,\" said Otah, who hasn't practiced since training camp began. \"Little upset with that, but I've got to move on and try to get back out there.\" Geoff Schwartz proved to be a capable backup as a rookie last year starting in Otah's place in the final three games, including in Panthers's 41-9 win over the Giants when Jonathan Stewart rushed for 206 yards. But behind the starting line is uncertainty. The only other linemen on the roster are Garry Williams, who played in seven games mostly on special teams as an undrafted rookie last year, and Tim Duckworth, a journeyman who signed with Panthers on Aug. 30. \"Either way, most people are only going to be able to suit up seven or eight of them,\" coach John Fox said of the offensive line. \"I feel comfortable with that.\" Otah, who became an immediate starter after being a first-round pick in 2008, said he hasn't had swelling in the knee, just nagging pain. \"I didn't expect it to take this long. It's frustrating,\" Otah said. \"All I can do is try to rehab as hard as I can and get back out there.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5551096", "Entities": ["Panthers", "Giants", "Geoff Schwartz", "Garry Williams", "John Fox"]}, {"title": "Mike Jenkins enjoys stress-free feeling", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "There is less stress in cornerback Mike Jenkins' football life in 2010. At the beginning of last season, Mike Jenkins and Orlando Scandrick were battling for the starting job -- alternating as the starter in the first two weeks of the regular season. \"I was going home. I was going back to Tampa,\" Mike Jenkins, a Tampa native, said of his Week 1 start in 2009. \"I had a lot of energy going into that game, a lot of stress just battling that whole situation.\" Mike Jenkins won the job and, by season's end, had established himself as one of the up-and-coming corners in the game by earning a Pro Bowl berth in just his second season. He finished with a team-leading five interceptions, the most on the team since 2007 when Anthony Henry grabbed six. As the Cowboys enter the 2010 regular season, Mike Jenkins is securely in place opposite Terence Newman. Orlando Scandrick, a good young player, is the slot corner who comes in on third-receiver sets. Mike Jenkins had proved to the Cowboys that they can depend on him, whether it be in press or zone coverages. Secondary coach Dave Campo trusts Mike Jenkins so much that he allows the corner to play press coverage anytime he wants, unless the Cowboys want all their corners to play a certain way. Mike Jenkins, who played press coverage at the University of South Florida, had to adjust to the pro game, where zone coverage is used quite a bit. He struggled at judging the ball and was thinking too much. Once he began to grasp zone coverage last season, Mike Jenkins began to play with more instinct. \"Right now, I'm relieved of the stress because we're not battling,\" Mike Jenkins said of the competition with Orlando Scandrick. \"I'm just keeping the same preparation. You try not to mess up and try to stay on top of the game and try to stay good with the coaches. It's a different type of stress. It's hard to play with when you have a lot on your shoulders.\" Now to the weekly mailbag. Q: Who do you think will be the MVP of the Cowboys this season? -- Curtis Palmer (Cowboys) A: On offense, I would say Felix Jones. The young running back is going to get more carries this season. The more he touches the ball, the more potent the offense will be. He won't carry the ball 20 times a game, but if he touches it 15 times a game -- including catching passes out of the backfield -- he can have an impact. On defense, it's easy to go with Jay Ratliff or DeMarcus Ware, but I would say Anthony Spencer will be the MVP. He had six sacks over the last six weeks of the 2009 season. More importantly, he had 17 quarterback pressures during the same span. He's another force opposite DeMarcus Ware. Q: Do you think the Cowboys will go after Myron Rolle off the Titans practice squad? -- Mark Miles (Flower Mound) A: Rolle is a fascinating story away from the field. In high school, he won the National Alliance of African American Athletes award (also known as the Watkins Award) as the top high school student based on academic, athletic and community achievement. He is a Rhodes Scholar recipient. It's crazy that NFL teams questioned his commitment to the sport. For now, Rolle is with the Titans. And with the Cowboys having five safeties on the active roster, it's doubtful they would grab him. Q: Mr. Watkins, I was wondering, do you see the Cowboys going after Tony Curtis? The Cowboys only have two tight ends, and he just got released by the 49ers. I'm pretty sure he knows the system better than Martin Rucker. Also, what are your thoughts on the Cowboys adding a veteran offensive lineman or defensive back? -- Bobby (Shindand, Afghanistan) A: Bobby, I doubt they will bring Tony Curtis back. The team likes Rucker's potential and, once he gets up to speed with the offense, I wouldn't be surprised if he's moved to the active roster. The Cowboys don't want a veteran corner or offensive lineman. They had a veteran corner in Cletis Gordon, and he was cut Saturday. It's better to go with younger linemen, because they have a better future. Q: What's the status of Roy E. Williams as wide receiver for the Cowboys. Where is he on the depth chart? -- Bill (Vermont) A: Williams is the starting wide receiver opposite Miles Austin. Williams had a pretty productive training camp and looked pretty good in the preseason -- better than Miles Austin, I thought. Williams knows the offense, but he as struggled with finding regular-season consistency and developing a chemistry with QB Tony Romo. If Williams can be consistent in running routes and catching the ball, he might have a good 2010. Williams and Tony Romo have both said the chemistry between them is getting better. Q: Pass protection has been suspect, and we haven't seen much of a running game. Do you see the Cowboys running game being productive against the Redskins defense? -- Chazz B (Lancaster, Pa.) A: You should be concerned about the pass protection, especially with two starters out for Sunday's game. But Montrae Holland and Alex Barron have been starters in this league, so it's not like you have inexperienced players out there. Jason Witten will help Barron and Doug Free, if necessary, and the Cowboys will have two fullbacks active for the game. The running game bothers me. From what we've seen in the preseason, there was little room to maneuver for the running backs. The Cowboys hope this changes Sunday night. Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.

DVOA and Football Outsiders' other advanced stats are explained here. Because it is the first week of the regular season, the analysis below is based on 2009 numbers. Vikings at Saints (8:30 p.m. ET, NBC) Vikings led all defenses by hurrying quarterbacks on 24 percent of pass plays last year, and while Drew Brees had an amazing 2009 season, he wasn't quite himself when he felt a lot of pressure: He averaged just 5.1 yards per pass when hurried last year (compared to 8.5 yards per pass overall). While he avoided turnovers against the Vikings in the playoffs and was sacked only once, he also under 200 passing yards -- which happened only three other times in 2009. Of course, the pass-pressure problem goes both ways. The Saints rushed six or more pass-rushers 23 percent of the time last season, the highest rate in the league, and Vikings QB Brett Favre averaged only 5.5 net yards per play against a big blitz of six or more (compared to 7.5 net yards per play the rest of the time).

A few days before the Jets' AFC divisional playoff game this past January in Chargers, Rex Ryan summoned his offensive coordinator to his office to let him know the Bills wanted to interview him for their head-coaching vacancy. Schottenheimer, who orchestrated the NFL's best rushing attacks in 2009, decided to pass. \"I was shocked,\" Rex Ryan said. Schottenheimer: \"I kind of floored Rex.\" Head-coaching opportunities don't come along that often, but Schottenheimer pledged his allegiance to Rex Ryan and the Jets, cementing a relationship that appeared a bit tenuous at one point. Actually, the final layer of cement was poured a few days later, when Rex Ryan made a thoughtful gesture that nearly brought Schottenheimer to tears. Rex Ryan's mouth, Mark Sanchez's right arm and Darrelle Revis' bank account have been the big stories around the Jets, who open the season Monday night against the Ravens, but one of the keys to 2010 will be Schottenheimer's brain. You know what you're going to get from the Jets' vaunted defense, especially with Darrelle Revis back on his island, but Schottenheimer's offense is the wild card. Will he mess with the smashmouth personality by letting Mark Sanchez throw more than last season? Can he turn Mark Sanchez into a consistent passer? Can he handle the egos and personalities in the offensive meeting room? Schottenheimer has experienced a lot in his relatively short career as a coordinator -- Brett Favre, anyone? -- but this could be his toughest challenge, molding a Super Bowl-caliber offense around a second-year quarterback. \"You have a very young quarterback,\" said Marty Schottenheimer, Brian's father and a former NFL coach. \"Offensively, that will be the focal point. I know there's going to be pressure on Brian, but I've always said he's very mature for his age. He knows what needs to be done.\" In four seasons as the Jets' coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, 36, has finished 25th, 26th, 16th and 20th in total offense. Those rankings aren't great, but he's had four starting quarterbacks and an unsettling lack of continuity. Barring injury, this will be the first time he's had the same starter in back-to-back seasons -- and he's prepared to reveal never-before-seen parts of his playbook. \"There are so many more options -- one with personnel, two with the playbook,\" Mark Sanchez said. \"[We can] open it up a bit.\" One of Schottenheimer's biggest challenges will be finding the right balance between the run and the pass. The Jets ran a league-high 607 times last season. Basically, he out-Marty'd Marty. In 21 years as a head coach, Marty Schottenheimer, whose conservative style became known as \"Marty Ball,\" never ran more than 559 times. It's ironic, considering Brian Schottenheimer, who played quarterback and coached the position, is a passing guy at heart. But Rex Ryan wanted to ground and pound, so they grounded and pounded and swaggered all the way to the AFC Championship Game. The objective this season, according to Schottenheimer, is to be a 50-50 offense. Based on last season's play total (1,030), that would mean 122 more pass attempts -- about eight per game. Schottenheimer devoted about five months of his life -- February through June -- making sure Mark Sanchez is ready for that jump. They worked side by side for countless hours, pouring over every nuance of the position. They forged a close bond, playing golf together, going to dinner and sharing family time. Mark Sanchez got to know Schottenheimer's wife, Gemmi, so well that she started dispensing relationship advice to the bachelor quarterback. The quarterback and his coach are only 13 years apart, so it became a big brother-little brother thing. \"I like to mess with Schotty, telling him those gray hairs came from one year with me,\" Mark Sanchez said. Truth be told, Mark Sanchez is one of the reasons Schottenheimer decided to say no to the Bills. After investing a year in the young quarterback, he didn't want to bail out with so much potential still untapped. He immediately called Mark Sanchez at home to let him know he wasn't interested in the job. \"His commitment to me gave me a lot of confidence,\" Mark Sanchez said. \"I still remember how he phrased it:'I'm coming back. I want to be here. We're going to win a lot of games together.'\" They weren't winning last November, when Rex Ryan announced he was getting involved in the offense, attending meetings and making suggestions. Previously, he had stayed away, letting Schottenheimer run the show with no one looking over his shoulder. At the time, Schottenheimer said he was \"stung\" by Rex Ryan's decision, fueling speculation that the relationship was on the rocks. \"I was unhappy with the situation in that Rex felt like he had to get involved,\" Schottenheimer recalled. \"We all take pride in what we do. It was never that I was unhappy with Rex. He was great. He came to me and said,'This is what I feel.' I said,'No problem.'\" Rex Ryan hatched the color-coded play-calling system, which might have helped Mark Sanchez's decision-making. Schottenheimer also streamlined the game plans for Mark Sanchez, who blossomed into an efficient quarterback for the stretch drive. They won a playoff game, and another. Rex Ryan was telling the media he expected to lose Schottenheimer after the season, almost pushing him to leave. Schottenheimer was comfortable with his decision to stay, but he didn't realize how comfortable until after the Chargers game. Marty Schottenheimer was watching the Jets-Chargers game from a bar in Orlando, Fla., where he was attending a college all-star game. This was personal for him on two levels. The Chargers were the organization that unceremoniously fired him after a 14-win season in 2006, and now his son had a chance to exact family revenge. \"I wouldn't insult your intelligence and say it was just another game, because it wasn't,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I was like a caged animal, marching up and down behind the bar.\" The Jets pulled a stunning upset. A couple of days later, Rex Ryan, knowing how much the victory meant to the Schottenheimer family, told Brian he was sending a game ball to his father. And he did. The ball is proudly displayed in Marty's home office in North Panthers. \"That made me realize I made the right decision,\" Brian Schottenheimer said. \"Anybody who thinks about something like that, as we're getting ready to go to the AFC Championship Game.... It showed how much respect and admiration Rex has for people. It reinforced that, hey, I'm working for a great guy. I'd do anything for the guy.\" Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com.

He has been the most consistent at the position.\" To give themselves more flexibility up front, the Dolphins re-signed offensive lineman Cory Procter, who had been released last week. Procter can play guard or center, while Grove is strictly a center. The Dolphins have added eight players since Saturday, an unusual flurry of activity so close to the start of the season. They've parted with several key 2009 acquisitions in recent days, including second-round draft pick Pat White and third-round pick Patrick Turner.

Browns's big man is working his way into shape and said he expects to play in Sunday's season opener in Buccaneers.

The club is well stocked with quality at quarterback, receiver and tight end. And while there are no consistent breakaway threats at running back and there are depth concerns along the offensive line, those units still have productive players who are talented enough to help win ballgames. There is less certainty on defense, where questions remain on whether the line will be able to hold up at the point of attack and whether there is a viable option to start at one outside linebacker spot. Also, the secondary is young and relatively untested. Here is a look at the roster, position by position, while considering where it ranks from an NFL perspective: Starter: Tom Brady Backup: Brian Hoyer Analysis: For the second straight season, the team will keep just two players at the position. About half the clubs in the NFL kept just two signal-callers in 2009. Tom Brady was sharp this preseason, while Hoyer, who made the club as a rookie free agent last season, showed that he continues to make positive strides. Overall, the Patriots' personnel at the position ranks as one of the NFL's best. Starter: Fred Taylor Backups: Kevin Faulk, Sammy Morris, Laurence Maroney, BenJarvus Green-Ellis Analysis: While the Patriots aren't going to morph into a Jets -style ground-and-pound attack, there were some promising signs in the preseason when it came to situational, short-yardage running with Taylor and Morris. That's why they project to get the ball over Maroney at the start of the year. Faulk remains a weapon as a pass-catcher out of the backfield. With Taylor, Morris and Faulk all in their 30s, Maroney and BenJarvus Green-Ellis provide youthful depth and insurance should injuries strike. This unit ranks low from an overall NFL perspective, in part because there is not a clear number 1 back in the group. Starters: Randy Moss, Wes Welker, Brandon Tate Backups: Julian Edelman, Taylor Price, Matthew Slater Analysis: Moss looks motivated to have a big year and, as he showed in the preseason, he can still run well and threaten opponents in the deep third of the field. Meanwhile, Wes Welker's recovery from a torn ACL and MCL has been quicker than anticipated, and Brandon Tate and Julian Edelman appear primed to make significant leaps from their rookie seasons, assuming they stay healthy. This looks like it could be one of the NFL's more explosive receiving groups. Starter: Alge Crumpler Backups: Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez Analysis: When training camp began, the Patriots were the only team in the NFL to not bring back a tight end from 2009, and the revamped group showed in the preseason that it figures to play a major role in the team's attack. Alge Crumpler is a powerful blocker in the running game and still is a factor in the short to intermediate passing game, while the 6-foot-6, 265-pound Rob Gronkowski looks like an X-factor who could help the team improve in the red zone. Aaron Hernandez is a chess piece who figures to be moved all over the field. If what transpired in the preseason carries to the regular season, the Patriots could have an upper-tier group from an NFL perspective. Starters: Matt Light (LT), Dan Connolly (LG), Dan Koppen (C), Stephen Neal (RG), Sebastian Vollmer (RT) Backups: Mark LeVoir (OT), Ryan Wendell (C/G), Quinn Ojinnaka (OT/G), Steve Maneri (OT) Injured: Nick Kaczur (OT/G) Analysis: The Patriots are holding a roster spot for Kaczur at this point, with the hope that he might recover from an injured back to help at some point. The starting line had a solid preseason, but the questions come in the depth department. Ojinnaka, who was acquired in a trade with the Falcons, is suspended for the season's first game and does not count against the roster limit. When he comes back, the team will have to trim from somewhere to create room. The offensive line without Logan Mankins looks like it's middle of the pack when compared with other NFL clubs. Starters: Gerard Warren (LDE), Vince Wilfork (NT), Mike Wright (RDE) Backups: Ron Brace (LDE), Myron Pryor (NT), Brandon Deaderick (RDE), Kyle Love (NT) Analysis: Ty Warren's season-ending hip injury is a significant blow and altered the Patriots' initial plans to have a Ty Warren /Vince Wilfork/Gerard Warren starting trio. The trickle-down effect is that Gerard Warren moves to the left side and Wright becomes a full-time player. Wright is one of the team's best interior pass rushers and projects to stay on the field on third down, so the concern is that he might wear down with a full-time role. Brace looks like a better fit at end than nose, and if he emerges as a starter, that would be a big boost. Deaderick (late seventh-round pick) and Kyle Love (rookie free agent) beat the odds to earn spots as developmental types. From an NFL perspective, this position looks like a middle-of-the-pack group. Starters: Tully Banta-Cain (OLB), Jerod Mayo (ILB), Brandon Spikes (ILB) Backups: Jermaine Cunningham (OLB), Marques Murrell (OLB), Rob Ninkovich (OLB), Gary Guyton (ILB), Dane Fletcher (ILB), Tracy White (ILB) Analysis: The Patriots play a 3-4 alignment so they'll need to find a starter on the outside among the group of Jermaine Cunningham, Murrell and Rob Ninkovich. At this point, it is a challenge to name any of them starters as they don't have a career start between them. Murrell started the first two preseason games, so he looks like the opening-day starter by process of elimination. Jermaine Cunningham, a second-round draft choice out of Florida, has missed all four preseason games because of injury but could find himself thrown into the fire quickly. On the inside, Brandon Spikes stepped in for the injured Gary Guyton on the fourth day of camp and hasn't looked back. From a league point of view, the Patriots have one of the more promising groups at inside linebacker, but the questions on the outside drag them down to the back half of the NFL. Starters: Devin McCourty (LCB), Darius Butler (RCB), Brandon Meriweather (S), Patrick Chung (S) Backups: Jonathan Wilhite (CB), Kyle Arrington (CB), Terrence Wheatley (CB), James Sanders (S), Jarrad Page (S) Analysis: Bill Belichick has never entered a season with such a young secondary, which is a result of losing eight-year veteran cornerback Leigh Bodden (torn rotator cuff) and sixth-year veteran safety Brandon McGowan (torn pectoral muscle) to season-ending injuries. The performance of this group will reflect, in part, how well the team drafted because all four starters were selected within the draft's first 41 picks -- Devin McCourty a 2010 first-round pick, Butler a 2009 second-round pick, Brandon Meriweather a 2007 first-round pick and Patrick Chung a 2009 second-round pick. NFL-wise, the secondary has the potential to be a top group, but until they prove it, they reside in the middle. Starters: Stephen Gostkowski (kicker), Zoltan Mesko (punter/holder); Jake Ingram (long snapper) Analysis: There was no significant competition for any of the three jobs as the Patriots have done well in recent years identifying top specialists in the draft and then scooping other teams to select them. Stephen Gostkowski is a Pro Bowl-caliber kicker and how he adjusts to the new field-goal operation with Zoltan Mesko as his holder will be important to monitor. As far as specialists go in the NFL, this group has potential to be among the best. Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPN Boston.

It was unexpected so we got him to the airport Tuesday afternoon and communicated with him last night. \"As you can understand, it's very, very difficult.\" Nora Lee Cooper Will Witherspoon was 56.

Jeff Fisher said the Titans are leaving it up to Will Witherspoon when to return to the team, though the veteran told the coach he plans to be back for Sunday's opener against Raiders.

As quarterback, he's long been considered the leader of 49ers's offense anyway. He spent the offseason showing everybody why. Alex Smith altered his own schedule to take time to throw to different receivers who needed work. He committed countless hours to studying at team headquarters and picking the brains of offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye and quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson. \"He's the quarterback. He's the captain of the whole team,\" receiver Michael Crabtree said Thursday. \"He runs the ship. He is a captain.\" Now, Alex Smith actually has the title. Coach Mike Singletary made the call this week heading into the 49ers' season opener Sunday at Seahawks. It's the first time in Alex Smith's six NFL seasons that he's been a regular captain -- and he joins Pro Bowl tight end Vernon Anthony Davis and star linebacker Patrick Willis among others. Early in his career, Alex Smith was a captain on occasion but the duties shifted game to game. \"I voted,\" Mike Singletary said of his decision, which he announced to Alex Smith on Wednesday. Alex Smith is in a new yet old position, beginning this season as the starter for the first time since a Monday Night opener in 2007. But he got hurt in Game 4 that year and missed nearly a month, then made only three more starts the rest of the way before sitting out injured for all 2008. The number 1 draft pick out of Utah in 2005, Alex Smith reinjured his surgically repaired throwing shoulder a few days before the'08 season opener. He was set to be the backup to J.T. O'Sullivan. Alex Smith began last year as the number 2 quarterback behind Shaun Hill only to take the job at halftime of the Niners' seventh game at Texans on Oct. 25 -- given a big chance to resurrect his career. Considering all the ups and downs he's faced in a relatively short NFL tenure so far, Alex Smith doesn't take anything for granted. Like his starting spot. Or captain privileges. \"I guess you get the title of it, I guess everybody feels in some way they have different leadership skills and how they do things,\" he said. \"Obviously, getting acknowledged for it is nice. I guess either way, it felt like I had a leadership role on this team, especially on offense.... You still have to go out there and play.\" Alex Smith is in the final season of the two-year deal he restructured in March 2009 that sharply reduced his base salary. Alex Smith threw for 2,350 yards and 18 touchdowns last season but also had 12 interceptions and was sacked 22 times for 134 lost yards. He's as prepared and comfortable in the huddle as ever heading into this season, one in which this franchise is greatly depending on him to end a seven-year playoff drought. Anything less than a postseason berth will be a huge disappointment around here. \"We know that our side of the ball, in the locker room, that he's a big part of this team,\" running back Frank Gore said. \"We know in the huddle we've got to listen to him.... He talks a lot and tells us what to do. Even when we don't do something right, he comes to us and says we should have done this or done that.\" Said receiver Josh Morgan : \"He's ready to go, man, it's the season opener. He doesn't really need the title. He's got it, so the sky's the limit.\" Mike Singletary certainly hopes so. He's been saying since last season ended -- with a disappointing 8-8 record and no trip to the postseason despite a strong start -- that Alex Smith is the 49ers' guy, the incumbent number 1. Even after another former number 1 pick was signed in backup David Carr. Alex Smith's dedication to getting better, and making those around him better in the process, during the offseason did so much for everybody's confidence that he can handle the pressure of being the regular starter again. And that means playing behind an offensive line featuring a pair of rookie first-round picks in Anthony Vernon Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati. \"I didn't name him a captain because he's a quarterback,\" Mike Singletary said. \"I named him a captain because he exemplified this offseason the things that I wanted our captains to do. I think when you talk about the identity of the 49ers, Alex really put in the time. You know he was out here when no one was out here. He was the guy that got the receivers together and threw to them, and changed his schedule around to meet with some other receivers. So, he was not just doing it once a day, he was doing it twice a day, as well as in the classroom. He was wearing Jimmy Raye and Mike Johnson out all offseason. Those are the things that we need.\" Alex Smith insists he hasn't strayed far from the approach he's always taken as a quarterback. He just committed himself to doing even more at this stage of his career, no longer having to focus so much of his energy on getting healthy or competing every snap of every practice to earn a job. \"You try to push yourself and constantly improve and that's on and off the field as a quarterback,\" he said. \"But really, I kind of just continued to do what I've always done, work hard and be the guy I am. I'm not trying to be anyone I'm not. I think it naturally happens just from the stability that's been here this last year.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5551540", "Entities": ["Alex Smith", "49ers", "Michael Crabtree", "Mike Singletary", "Seahawks", "Anthony Davis", "Patrick Willis", "Shaun Hill", "Texans", "Frank Gore", "Josh Morgan", "Mike Iupati"]}, {"title": "Source: Bears look at Keenan Burton", "author": null, "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- The Bears plan to bring in free-agent receiver Keenan Burton for a workout on Tuesday, according to an NFL source. Reported originally by NFL.com, the club's plans to bring in Burton don't come as a surprise, considering the receiver's upside. A fourth-round pick of the Rams in 2008, Burton was somewhat of a surprise release by the Rams after he started six of nine games last season, catching 25 passes for 253 yards. The 6-foot, 206-pound Burton struggled to stay healthy in the preseason due to knee problems, which have also plagued him the previous two seasons. The Rams released Burton to make room on the roster for Mark Clayton, who was acquired through a trade. Burton missed three games as a rookie due to knee surgery to repair torn cartilage from an injury sustained in his NFL debut. Burton returned in the ninth game against Saints, and suffered a season-ending right-knee injury that required surgery to repair a patellar tendon. Burton played in 22 games for Rams with seven starts, and was widely considered to be one of the favorites of Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo because of his work ethic. Considered to be a possession receiver, Burton caught eight passes for 57 yards in the preseason prior to his release. Michael C. Wright covers the Bears for ESPNBears.com and ESPN 1000.

The Cardinals' second-year running back sat out practice again on Thursday with a sore right knee. He said the knee is \"a lot better\" but it would be the coach's decision on whether he would play in the Cardinals' season opener Sunday in Rams. \"We'll see,\" coach Ken Whisenhunt said. \"If he can make the kind of progress he's made the last couple of days then we'll see where he is on game day.\" The team has three other running backs, so Ken Whisenhunt said the Cardinals can be cautious with the injury. \"What concerns me is I don't want this to be something that in week 12 or week 13 or week 14 that you're having issues with,\" the coach said. \"Like we said earlier in the week, we're going to be conservative on it. If we feel like Beanie's made enough progress by Sunday, then he'll play. If we don't, then like I said, I feel very strong at that position.\" Asked about the possibility of missing the opener in what is supposed to be a big season for him, Beanie Wells flashed his trademark smile and said, \"Sixteen games. It's a long season.\" Even if he was healthy, Beanie Wells still would be behind starter Tim Hightower on the depth chart. Beanie Wells, a first-round draft pick out of Ohio State, led the team in rushing with 793 yards in 176 carries, an average of 4.5 yards per carry. Tim Hightower enters his third NFL season after being picked in the fifth round out of Richmond. The burly Tim Hightower carried 143 times for 598 yards (4.2 yards per carry) and caught 63 passes -- second-most among NFL running backs behind Ravens's Ray Rice -- for 428 yards. Tim Hightower also is one of the league's better protectors during a blitz, something Cardinals might need with its remodeled offensive line. \"When I came in my first year, it was pretty much explained to me'Either you're going to pick up your pass protection or you're not going to play this week,'\" he said. \"So I think mentally it was kind of a thing, either I had to get good at this real quick or I wasn't going to see the football field.\" Beanie Wells said he thinks he's \"doing great\" in developing his pass blocking. \"I'm picking it up well,\" he said. \"The most important thing for me is to know what I'm doing, know my assignments and what guy to block on each play and I think I'm doing that just fine.\" Beanie Wells struggled a bit in the preseason, gaining 75 yards in 25 carries. He also fumbled the ball away late in the first half in Bears at the Bears' 6-yard line. Beanie Wells still contends he was down before the ball came loose. Besides, he said, \"It's the preseason, so you take it for what it's worth. I understand last year I wanted to come out and have a great preseason because it was my first NFL experience. This year to take a back seat to that, you know it's preseason. It's going to be a long season ahead of you. I don't think any of the top backs had a great preseason.\" Kurt Warner no longer lights up the field with passes for the Cardinals. In his place is Derek Anderson, who has a big-time arm but has had problems with accuracy. Expect Cardinals to try to lean heavily on the 1-2 running punch of Tim Hightower and Beanie Wells. \"We're gearing up to be a running football team,\" Beanie Wells said. \"I like that.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5551890", "Entities": ["Beanie Wells", "Cardinals", "Rams", "Ken Whisenhunt", "Tim Hightower", "Ravens", "Ray Rice", "Bears", "Derek Anderson"]}, {"title": "Gary Kubiak's Texans must beat Colts", "author": "John Clayton", "date": "Sep 9, 2010", "content": "If the Texans can't top the Colts in their season opener, it might never happen. For eight years, the Texans tried to climb out of the chaos of expansion and become a winning team. In 2009, quarterback Matt Schaub threw for 4,770 yards and the Texans finally topped.500. But if the Texans, 9-7 last season, are going to take the next step and be a serious playoff contender, they must start establishing home-field advantage against teams in the AFC South, especially the Colts. In the past three seasons, the Texans have gone 4-14 in divisional play. Last year, they went 1-5, forcing them to go 8-2 in the non-divisional games to get over.500. To repeat that and expect to go 8-2 against the rest of the league will almost be impossible, particularly considering the Texans have the league's toughest schedule. This Sunday, the Texans highlight the season debut of First And 10 because they have a decent chance to beat Colts. They catch Peyton Manning when he might be a little out of his comfort zone. Unless Charlie Chris Johnson heals quickly from a foot injury that has sidelined him for five weeks, Peyton Manning might have to go into the opener in Texans with undrafted rookie left tackle Jeff Linkenbach starting. Tony Ugoh, for whom the Colts traded a first-round pick to be the left tackle of the future, was waived Wednesday. The left tackle must keep defensive end Mario Williams away from Peyton Manning. Peyton Manning might not be at the total comfort level with the location of umpire Chad Brown, who will work with Ed Hochuli's crew in this game. Brown is a longtime umpire known for standing on the defensive line and absorbing plenty of hits through the years. For safety reasons, the umpire has been moved behind the offense, which slows down no-huddle attacks. It might take weeks before the league figures out the proper mechanics of the umpire spotting the ball and getting into his position. This could infringe on Peyton Manning's play-calling in the no-huddle, but this subject is such a point of discussion in the league office that the crew will do its best to make things work. But more eyes will be on coach Gary Kubiak and his Texans. The franchise is 1-15 all time against the Colts. If the Texans go 1-16, they will be chasing Peyton Manning and the Colts all season and their only route to the playoffs will probably be as a wild card. It's one of the biggest must-win games of the season. The Texans must win -- or else. Other things to watch in Week 1: 1. Revenge for the \"Hard Knocks\" guy? Rex Matt Rex Ryan felt he should have been selected the Ravens' coach instead of John Harbaugh, but he was professional about the rejection. Matt Rex Ryan stayed with Ravens for the 2008 season, telling everyone he would coach the Ravens' defense to the playoffs and then get a head coaching job. He accomplished both. This game means everything to Matt Rex Ryan. He has re-established the Jets as a powerhouse. The Jets return the league's top defense and feel better about their offense. The opener of the ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" doubleheader also features the proud defense he left behind under the control of linebacker Ray Lewis. Expect a physical game, but also watch the development of Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who should break out this season. The Ravens are expected to try more no-huddle this year and they can do it with Anquan Boldin, Derrick Mason and T.J. Houshmandzadeh catching the ball. This should be a classic. 2. Tough going for Kevin Kolb? Eagles quarterback Kevin Kolb, who has just two starts in three seasons, and Packers QB Aaron Rodgers meet on Sunday. Each has replaced a legendary quarterback. The Eagles felt Kevin Kolb fit better as a rhythm quarterback in Andy Reid's West Coast offense, so they didn't fear trading Donovan McNabb to division rival Redskins. They are confident Kevin Kolb is good enough to take the Eagles to new heights. The Packers have similar confidence in Aaron Rodgers, who replaced Brett Favre. In 2008, Aaron Rodgers threw for 4,038 yards as a first-year starter but he -- like most first-year quarterbacks -- struggled in fourth quarters and Packers finished 6-10. Aaron Rodgers now can win those fourth-quarter games while Kevin Kolb, who has only two NFL starts, must learn. 3. The Raiders' commitment to defense: For years, the Raiders' defenses used to pad the numbers of Chargers running back LaDainian Mike Tomlinson. Most figured he'd go for 140 yards a game against the Raiders' run defense. Al Davis finally thinks he has resolved the run defense problem. He has three new starting linebackers, including rookie Rolando McClain. In the past year, he has added Richard Seymour, John Henderson, Jay Alford and rookie Lamarr Texans to the defensive line. For confidence, the Raiders couldn't have drawn a worse opening game. They face Chris Charlie Chris Johnson of the Titans, who has his eyes on a repeat of a 2,000-yard rushing season and maybe 2,500 combined years. Can the Raiders hold him to under 100? If they can't, confidence could be effected. At least the Raiders won't see L.T. this season. 4. Cowboys' support of Mike Shanahan's Haynesworth stance: The last thing the Cowboys want to see is Albert Haynesworth on the field. Heck, the Cowboys probably would help the Redskins throw in an extra draft choice so Haynesworth can be traded to the Titans. On Sunday night, the Cowboys open at FedEx Field knowing right tackle Marc Colombo and left guard Kyle Kosier won't play because of knee injuries. Doug Free is the new starting left tackle, creating a 60 percent turnover in the blocking protection for Tony Romo. The last thing Cowboys wants to see is an angry Haynesworth, who still can draw double-team blocks when he gets on a roll. Mike Shanahan opted not to trade Haynesworth for less than a high pick in the 2011 draft, but he probably won't start the disgruntled defender. Tony Romo should be happy about that. 5. The Greatest Show at Soldier Field: Mike Martz, the Bears' new offensive coordinator, unveils his new Cutler offense against the Lions. The numbers could be scary. Safety Louis Delmas is the only player back for the Lions' 32nd-ranked secondary of a year ago and his status is uncertain because of a persistent groin injury. Martz will attack Chris Texans, Jonathan Wade and other castoff corners along with safety C.C. Brown. Some say the C.C. stands for \"Can't Cover.\" Martz knows last year's strategy against the Lions was to spread the field with three or four receivers and throw. 6. Young and the restless for Bill Belichick: In drafting a dozen players each of the past two years, Patriots coach Bill Belichick figured eventually to have a young defense. He just didn't figure it to be this season. He's lost the experience of Ty Warren (injured reserve), Leigh Bodden (injured reserve) and Brandon McGowan (injured reserve). His starting secondary has five combined seasons of NFL experience and he has new starters at linebacker in Marques Murrell and rookie Brandon Spikes. Tom Brady is 7-1 in season openers at home, but the Pats drew a tough assignment in the Bengals. Carson Palmer is loaded on offense with the additions of Terrell Owens, Jermaine Gresham and Jordan Shipley. 7. John Fox in the new Giants digs: Panthers coach John Fox is in the final season of his contract. The former Giants defensive coordinator would love to someday become Big Blue's head coach. He had a great audition Dec. 27, 2009, when the visiting Panthers chased the Giants out of their old stadium with a 41-9 thrashing. Sunday, he could ruin the Giants' official housewarming of the New Meadowlands Stadium. The 2010 Panthers have the youngest roster in the NFL. Giants coach Tom Coughlin is trying to fix problems along the offensive line and on defense and bounce back from a difficult 2009 season. 8. Was Dixon the right choice? : With regular quarterback Ben Roethlisberger out four weeks with a suspension, Mike Tomlin went for the fresh legs of Dennis Dixon as the Week 1 starter against the Falcons. Mike Tomlin chose Dixon instead of the more experienced Charlie Batch after Byron Leftwich suffered a preseason knee injury. Dixon shows flashes of brilliance with his arm and running ability, but for the Steelers to come out of the first four games better than 1-3, they need consistent quarterback play. The Dixon- Matt Rex Ryan matchup is particularly tough because Matt Rex Ryan probably will use a lot of no-huddle to tire the hard-hitting Steelers defense and keep it off balance. 9. Sun setting in NFC West: Seahawks coach Pete Carroll opens his return to the NFL with a roster as unsettled as Redskins State University's instead of the powerhouse he had at USC. He's made so many changes after the 53-man cutdown that name tags might be needed when the team huddles against the 49ers. For the Seahawks to contend, they can't afford losing a home game to the 49ers, a tough team that plans to test Seahawks's ability to stop the run. The Cardinals, meanwhile, visit the Rams for a Derek Anderson - Sam Bradford quarterback matchup. Years from now, Sam Bradford versus Derek Anderson might be a mismatch in favor of the Rams, but this is Sam Bradford's first game, so expect plenty of full blitzes by the Cardinals. 10. Bottom-feeders: Each week in First And 10, we'll briefly -- and I mean briefly -- examine the league's bottom-feeders, teams that could be on the clock for next spring's draft. The Buccaneers have the best chance to steal more wins than the rest of last season's six-win-or-less teams because they have four games against opponents that had five wins or less in 2009, starting with Sunday's opener against the Browns. Broncos coach Josh McDaniels' only non-division road game against a team with a 2009 losing record is Sunday's at the Jaguars; losing that game could doom the Broncos to a bad road record. The only thing going for the Bills in the opener against the Dolphins is the Dolphins' coaching staff has no idea how to plan for Chan Gailey's offense, which is void of receiving and tackle talent. In the nightcap of the ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" doubleheader, the Chiefs open at home against the Chargers. Chargers doesn't have receiver Vincent Jackson and offensive tackle Marcus McNeill (contract holdouts). Still, new Chiefs defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel must figure a way to contain quarterback Philip Rivers, which won't be easy.

Marc Colombo had arthroscopic surgery on Aug. 16 to remove five loose particles from his right knee. On that day, Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones said he expected Marc Colombo to return within 10 to 14 days. The Cowboys hope Marc Colombo will be able to practice next week and play in the Sept. 19 home opener against the Bears. Left guard Kyle Kosier is also expected to miss at least the season opener with a sprained MCL in his right knee suffered Aug. 18. That injury requires a recovery period of four to six weeks. Veterans Montrae Holland and Alex Barron will start at left guard and right tackle, respectively. The 6-foot-2, 326-pound Montrae Holland, who the Cowboys re-signed to a two-year contract in May despite not activating him for any games last season, has 48 starts in his eight-year career with the Saints, Broncos and Cowboys. The Cowboys acquired the 6-8, 316-pound Barron from the Rams, trading recently cut linebacker Bobby Carpenter in an exchange of disappointing first-round picks. Barron started 74 games -- 42 at right tackle -- in five seasons with the Rams, who replaced him by drafting Rodger Saffold with the 33rd overall pick. \"It gives me a lot of confidence in those two guys,\" coach Wade Phillips said of the reserve linemen's experience. \"Montrae Holland and Barron both have started and played and played well in a lot of games. That gives us confidence. And they've worked well in our system and worked hard. I don't think it's going to be perfect for them, but we have confidence that they'll do a good job for us.\" Added Barron: \"My confidence is high. This is not my first rodeo.\" Marc Colombo overcame a career-threatening knee injury suffered during his rookie season in 2002 with the Bears to become a reliable starter for the Cowboys. He started 57 consecutive games before suffering a broken right fibula and torn ankle ligaments that required surgery last season. He was sidelined for the rest of the regular season. Kyle Kosier missed 13 games in 2008 due to a broken right foot, a key factor in the Cowboys failing to make the playoffs that season. \"This is the ultimate team game,\" quarterback Tony Romo said. \"I think you have to have people able to step up and be in position to help you. We have a lot of confidence in the guys that are stepping up. They're good players as well. We're lucky enough to have some depth at those positions and we're going to keep battling.\" Tim MacMahon covers the Cowboys for ESPN Cowboys.

Some might say it's long overdue. With Michael Bush questionable due to a broken left thumb that required surgery, Darren McFadden is expected to take the majority of reps in Raiders's backfield for the season opener in Nashville. \"It's something I've been looking forward to and I think I'm ready for it,\" Darren McFadden said Thursday. \"I didn't get much preseason play but I don't think that's going to bother me much.\" Darren McFadden hurt himself early in training camp and had only seven carries in the preseason, all of them against 49ers on Aug. 28. He did not play in the preseason finale when Raiders rested most of its projected starters. The injury and down time are nothing new to Darren McFadden. Since entering the league as the fourth-overall pick in 2008, he has been beset by a variety of lingering injuries that have shelved him for long stretches. Darren McFadden averaged 108.5 carries in his first two NFL seasons and has just one 100-yard game on his resume. The plan entering 2010 was to have Darren McFadden and Michael Bush split the duties in Raiders's backfield. That changed slightly when Michael Bush's left thumb got smashed between two helmets in the game against 49ers. Michael Bush underwent surgery and had two screws inserted in his thumb, but coach Tom Cable remained optimistic the former fourth-round pick wouldn't be out long. Michael Bush joined his teammates in practice Wednesday and Tom Cable said he was \"shocked\" at a report saying Michael Bush would not play against the Titans. The outlook was a bit more pessimistic Thursday. Michael Bush, who wasn't available during media access, did not practice and strolled out to the field well after the rest of the players, wearing sweats and a white Raiders cap. He briefly served as an opposing player during an offensive line drill -- standing still and doing nothing more -- before watching the rest of practice. \"That will be a game-time decision,\" Tom Cable said of Michael Bush. \"Everything looks like he'll [practice] tomorrow.\" In the meantime, Darren McFadden is prepping to be the Raiders' workhorse until Michael Bush returns. Raiders will also lean more on backups Michael Bennett and Rock Cartwright. \"That's one of the things the coaches talk about, that there's not a big drop-off from the first guy to the last guy,\" Darren McFadden said. \"We're looking to go out and prove we are a contender, we're not just a pushover.\" That includes Darren McFadden himself. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell, the first-overall pick in 2007, was given his walking papers after three disappointing seasons. Now the critics are already lining up to take their shots at Darren McFadden. \"I know what I'm capable of doing so I just want to go out there and put it out there on the field,\" he said. \"For me you try not to think about it, you just do it.\" Yet there are those who wonder if he can. Tom Cable, in his second full season as the Raiders coach, is among those with questions about the third-year running back. \"I think everybody is waiting to see Darren stay healthy,\" Tom Cable said. \"If you look at his production it's been pretty good when he has played. That's what we want to see, just that consistent ability for him to go out there and stay on the field. When he does that, then all those questions or issues or whatever they are will be handled by him.\" WR Chaz Schilens (knee), DE Desmond Bryant (elbow), CB Walter Darren McFadden (hamstring) and LB Travis Goethel (back) were also held out of practice.... Tom Cable acknowledged the Raiders brought in free agent DE Bobby McCray for a workout on Wednesday.

Drew Brees and the Saints extended Saints' post-Super Bowl euphoria for at least another week and denied Brett Favre a victory in the Louisiana Superdome one more time. Drew Brees completed 27 of 36 passes for 237 yards and one touchdown, and the Saints survived a hard-fought season opener for a 14-9 victory over the Vikings on Thursday night. It wasn't the most spectacular way to open a title defense, considering it was a rematch of the riveting 2009 NFC title game last January, which the Saints won in overtime to advance to their first Super Bowl. \"We're not used to 14-9 victories, but we're used to winning,\" said Drew Brees, the reigning Super Bowl MVP. \"So we like the W.\" It was the lowest-scoring victory of the Sean Payton era, which began in 2006, but the Saints will take it, especially after their defense limited Brett Favre to 171 yards passing and one touchdown. \"I know people are going to say it wasn't the fireworks they expected it to be,\" Brett Favre said. Although his offense was far less potent than usual, Sean Payton said he \"was proud of the way we came through and made enough plays to start the season 1-0.\" Unlike the NFC championship game, the Vikings didn't lose a fumble and turned the ball over only once on Jonathan Vilma's interception of Brett Favre, who made an ill-advised throw as Roman Harper hit him on a safety blitz. Also unlike their previous meeting, the Saints had most of the statistical advantages, outgaining Vikings 308 yards to 253 and controlling the ball for 33:43, compared to 26:17 for Vikings. \"We knew we would have to play better in a lot of areas than we did last year [against the Vikings] and I felt like we did,\" Drew Brees said. \"We just showed that we can win in a lot of different ways.\" Saints might have won the game more easily if not for two missed field goals by Garrett Hartley, who kicked the dramatic winning field goal last year. Still, Saints was able to kneel on the ball to run out most of the last two minutes after Pierre Thomas capped a 71-yard, one-touchdown performance with a 10-yard, first-down run right after the 2-minute warning. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who rushed for 122 yards and three TDs in the last meeting, rushed for 87 yards on 19 carries against Saints' stingy defense. \"We did a very good job of holding against the run and still taking some of the downfield throws away,\" Sean Payton said. Although the game was competitive, it hardly lived up to its hype. Brett Favre's comeback from ankle surgery, marking the start of his 20th season, was largely unspectacular. Despite being sacked only once and hit not nearly as often, or as hard, as in the NFC title game, he looked out of synch or inaccurate at times. The fact that Vikings was without star receiver Sidney Rice may have had something to do with that. \"There's three of four throws that I just missed,\" Brett Favre said. \"I have no excuse. I just missed.\" Brett Favre's best sequence came on Vikings's only touchdown drive late in the first half, when he found Visanthe Shiancoe on precision down-the-middle completions of 33 and 20 yards, the second for the Vikings' only TD. That gave Vikings a 9-7 halftime lead, which the Saints erased on their first drive of the second half. \"We were right where we wanted to be at halftime, then it was three-and-out, three-and-out,\" Vikings coach Brad Childress said. \"There were not a lot of throws to be made downfield. They were going to hold us down and make us bleed slowly.\" The Saints' triumph ended a long day of festivities which for some might have been more exciting than the game itself. Tailgaters were setting up around the Superdome at dawn, and one pregame cookout even doubled as a wedding. Some government offices, businesses and schools shut down. NFL-sponsored pregame festivities included a concert in the French Quarter featuring Dave Matthews and Taylor Swift, along with a Mardi Gras-style parade, for which police estimated the crowd at about 200,000. Shortly before kickoff, singer and Saints native Harry Connick Jr. entered the Superdome on a parade float with a giant replica of the silver Vince Lombardi Trophy. Also on the float was Saints owner Tom Benson, holding the real trophy. As Connick finished the first verse of, \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" a black championship banner was unfurled from the roof of the dome and Saints players streamed out of the tunnel to sustained and boisterous applause. Shortly before kickoff, Drew Brees stood on the 30-yard line, holding a fist up high before pumping his arm down in an orchestrated move to send the sellout crowd of 70,051 into a chants of: \"Who dat say dey gonna' beat dem Saints!\" Soon after, the Saints received the opening kickoff and scored on only five plays, with Drew Brees hitting three of his first four passes for 69 yards, including a 29-yard scoring strike to Devery Henderson on a rollout. Vikings made it 7-3 on Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal in the second quarter and the Vikings defense stifled Drew Brees and the Saints in the second quarter, allowing only 7 yards. Saints' only scoring threat in the quarter came after Jonathan Vilma's interception at the Vikings 34, but Garrett Hartley missed a 46-yard field goal. The Saints quickly regained their stride on their first drive of the second half, going 74 yards in 11 plays, capped by Pierre Thomas' 1-yard TD plunge up the middle. That turned out that was all the scoring the Saints needed. Game notes The defending Super Bowl champion has played host to the last seven Thursday night openers and won them all.... The previous lowest-scoring Saints victory under Sean Payton was his debut as a head coach in the 2006 regular season, a 19-14 win at Browns.... Drew Brees, who completed 75 percent of his passes without an interception, had a quarterback rating of 101.3, the 30th time in 64 regular season games with the Saints that is rating was above 100.... Brett Favre was 15 of 27 (56 percent) with one interception for a passer rating of 71.7.... Brett Favre needs two more TDs passing to become the first NFL quarterback with 500....

The two running backs sometimes grab lunch together and they play video games like \"Call of Duty\" online together all the time. Ahmad Bradshaw and Jacobs are like brothers and have been that way since Ahmad Bradshaw's arrival in 2007. Very little has changed between them over the years. And yet so much has changed between them this season. Little brother has usurped big brother and Ahmad Bradshaw is now the starting running back while Jacobs is the change of pace back who will come off the bench. The role reversal has been hard for the proud Jacobs to swallow. But Ahmad Bradshaw says nothing will change the relationship between he and Jacobs, no matter who gets the most carries or not. Ahmad Bradshaw said Jacobs' issue is with management. \"Not at all,\" Ahmad Bradshaw said. \"We are still brothers. If he has a problem with the front office, it has nothing to do with me, which he's told me. We are still brothers. We still have the same relationship.\" \"It's a business,\" Ahmad Bradshaw added. \"Different people have different aspects on it. Obviously, he has a different aspect.\" The past two days are a perfect example of how different things have become for the 5-foot-9 Ahmad Bradshaw and the 6-4 Jacobs. On Wednesday, Jacobs answered several questions but bristled whenever asked about anything pertaining to his new role or happiness. After saying it was tough to remain positive in the current situation last week, after failing to get a single carry in the preseason finale against the Patriots, Jacobs wasn't in the mood to discuss his situation on Wednesday. He was asked how he shared carries with Derrick Ward two seasons ago and whether he envisioned another scenario like that this season. \"I don't envision anything,\" Jacobs said. \"I come to work every day and work hard. Whatever happens, happens.\" But when he was asked if players have to put aside egos in a situation like that to make it work, Jacobs abruptly ended the interview and stormed off. \"You think I'm stupid, don't you?\" Jacobs asked before leaving. On Thursday, it was Ahmad Bradshaw's turn to talk and he could barely contain his enthusiasm about his new role. Make no mistake. Ahmad Bradshaw admits that being called the starter \"definitely\" means a lot to him. \"That is what I play the game for, I have worked hard these first three years, and going into my fourth year, I felt like I deserved it,\" Ahmad Bradshaw said. \"I am going to take pride in it and take advantage of it.\" Last season, both running backs struggled with injuries as the Giants failed to register a 1,000-yard rusher for the first time after seven consecutive seasons. Jacobs rushed for 835 yards while banged up. Despite playing with cracked bones in his feet and bone spurs in an ankle, Ahmad Bradshaw rushed for a career-high 778 yards and a team-high seven touchdowns. Both Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw underwent offseason surgery and both came back to camp healthy. Jacobs looked fast and showed burst in camp. But so did Ahmad Bradshaw, who was able to practice fully after largely being unable to practice last season. \"I feel 10 times more better than last year,\" Ahmad Bradshaw said. \"I can't wait to see what they [surgically repaired feet and ankle] do for me this year. The way I felt over the summer and training camp, I felt excellent. \"I feel as confident as ever this year. Being the starter makes me even more confident to be out there.\" Ahmad Bradshaw is downright giddy about the upcoming season. And in his first start of the year, he hopes to show everybody that the Giants' running game is back. And who better to do that against than Panthers, which features one of the best rushing tandems in DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. Both gained more than 1,000 yards last season. \"Our running game wasn't where it was supposed to be last year,\" Ahmad Bradshaw said. \"This year everybody is dedicated to the run even more than ever just to get back to having two 1,000-yard rushers.\" No matter what happens, one thing will not change and that is Ahmad Bradshaw and Jacobs' brotherly relationship. \"If anything I tell him all the time we are going to do this together,\" Ahmad Bradshaw said. \"I can't do it without him. If he is not focused, I am always going to be there for him. We talk to each other like brothers and it is going to be like that forever.\" Ohm Youngmisuk covers the Giants for ESPNNewYork.com.

Tom Brady arrived at the stadium Thursday morning and was involved in parts of meetings and a walk-through in addition to participating in the team's practice session as the Patriots prepare for Sunday's season opener against the Bengals. During the 11-minute portion of afternoon practice that reporters were allowed to watch Thursday, Tom Brady, in full uniform with pads and helmet, stretched as usual with his teammates. Then, as he usually does, he threw soft passes of 20 to 30 yards to teammates. Patriots coach Bill Belichick told the team about the accident before practice and said Tom Brady might be a bit late. \"He didn't make it seem like it was anything serious,\" outside linebacker Tully Banta-Cain said of Bill Belichick's remarks to the team. \"I saw [Tom Brady] a little while ago and he looks OK. I saw him walking in, he had a smile on his face, no abrasions. I think he's fine. That was my first reaction.\" Added veteran tight end Alge Crumpler : \"He's here, he's ready to go.\" Rookie tight end Rob Gronkowski said he caught a pass from Tom Brady in the pre-practice walk-through and that it was as crisp as ever. \"We're just all thankful he's fine, and glad he's back here already, and back working,\" Rob Gronkowski said. His initial reaction was concern. \"Obviously it's a shock, no matter who it is,\" Rob Gronkowski said. \"You never want to hear information like that. We're all thankful everyone is all right and he's here.\" The crash, at an intersection in Boston's Back Bay area blocks from Tom Brady's home, knocked over a light pole and sent a passenger in the other vehicle to the hospital with injuries that were serious but not considered life-threatening, a police report said. A police report says 21-year-old Ludgero Rodrigues was driving a Mercury Villager minivan that struck Tom Brady's Audi sedan. Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles spokeswoman Ann Dufresne says the driver's license of Rodrigues was suspended at least five times in three years. She says that includes a 180-day suspension last year after he was arrested for operating under the influence and refused to take a blood-alcohol test. Police say Rodrigues was cited Thursday for failing to stop at a red light. Two other people in the minivan were able to exit and had no visible injuries, witnesses said. A telephone listing for Rodrigues could not immediately be found Thursday. The police report, which did not name Tom Brady, said the driver of the Audi had no visible injuries and was evaluated by Emergency Medical Services. It said a 49-year-old passenger in the minivan had to be freed with the Jaws of Life and was taken to a hospital. \"I understand he's fine, but I haven't talked to him,\" Tom Brady's father, Tom Brady Sr., said outside his son's home in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. The elder Tom Brady had just arrived in Boston from the family's California home and found out about the accident as soon as he got off his flight. \"Not the way you like to get off a plane,\" he said. One of Tom Brady's neighbors, a 74-year-old woman who asked that her name not be used for fear of being hounded by media inquiries, was walking her dogs when she saw the accident. She said Tom Brady was traveling south on Gloucester Street and approaching the intersection on a green light when his car collided with a fast-moving minivan that was westbound on Commonwealth Avenue. \"The red car went up in the air, sideways.... The tire was half off,\" the woman said. Afterward, she said Tom Brady immediately got out of his car. The woman had been near the intersection when the crash occurred and fell down and hit her head while bracing for impact. She said the two sat next to each other in an ambulance, but neither was taken to the hospital. She did not realize he was the star quarterback until later. \"I want to thank the safety personnel for their service, and express our concern and support for the well-being of the occupants of the other vehicle,\" Tom Brady's agent, David Yee, said in a statement. \"I don't have any other information to share at this time.\" Another witness, Bill Barron, said he was in his apartment overlooking the intersection when he heard a collision that sounded like \"a bolt of lightning.\" When he looked out the window, he saw the driver of the car picking glass off his clothes and wiping himself off with a towel. He didn't realize until later that it was Tom Brady. \"I thought it was some college kid who had crashed up his father's really nice car,\" Barron said. Tom Brady then retrieved some items from his car, made a series of phone calls and was picked up by another vehicle, Barron said. On Wednesday, when he was peppered with questions about his long-term contract status, Tom Brady explained his \"different approach\" of how he now lives as if nothing is guaranteed in the future. He said that's why he focuses only on the present. The words probably carry some extra weight with Tom Brady after he escaped serious injury. \"You count your blessings when you come off the field,\" Tom Brady said. \"I think you have a new appreciation when you do come off the field, win or lose. You're trying to win every time out, obviously. But I think you also pinch yourself every time you walk off the field healthy and say,'Man, at least I get a chance to go out next week and play also.'\" The accident caused something of a media stir at Gillette Stadium on Thursday. As reporters rushed into the locker room when the media access period began, many filmed pictures of Tom Brady's locker, where a pair of jeans and a shirt were placed over a chair. It was a much busier scene than normal, with several television stations on hand preparing to go on the air live. Left tackle Matt Light found the crowd humorous as he walked through the locker room and cracked, \"It's just a car accident, people.\" One local television station even dispatched a helicopter to hover over the team's practice field and beam live video of Tom Brady playing catch. Tom Brady has played prominently in the news this week with several reports saying he was close to finalizing a contract extension with Patriots. Those reports materialized Thursday night, when sources close to negotiations confirmed that Tom Brady signed a four-year extension that will be filed with the NFL on Friday. The deal is worth $72 million, $48.5 million guaranteed, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The extension will be added on to the final year of Tom Brady's contract and goes through 2014, when he will be 37 years old. Tom Brady has said he wants to play until he's 40. Tom Brady, who was picked by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 draft, is making $6.5 million this season in the final year of a four-year, $48 million extension. Sports Illustrated's Peter King broke news of the agreement during halftime of NBC's broadcast of the NFL's season-opening game between the Saints and Vikings, saying he spoke to Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who told him the deal was finished.

Sure, all teams combine veterans with youth, but the construction of the Patriots accentuates the divide. The current Patriots 53-man roster has an average age of 26.8, making it the 13th youngest in the NFL, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. In other words, Patriots is in the middle of the pack from an age perspective. On average, the Patriots are more than a year older than the Panthers (25.6), the youngest team in the NFL. However, take a closer look and you'll see that the Patriots' average age is heavily impacted by an aging offense. So while the average age of the team is approaching 27 years old, 35 of the 53 players are 26 or younger. Of the 18 that are older, 10 are offensive starters. In fact, 10 of the 11 oldest players on the team fall on the offensive side of the ball. Gerard Warren (32) is the lone exception, and Tully Banta-Cain (30) is the only other 30-something on the defense. The current 53-man roster has 22 players in their first or second season. However, the youth movement is most apparent on the defensive side of the ball. Consider the secondary, where no one is older than 26 and three of the four likely starters are 24 or younger. No cornerback has more than two prior years of experience. The main reason for that is the loss of Leigh Bodden to a season-ending rotator cuff tear. Entering his eighth season, Bodden actually has one more year of pro experience than the current five cornerbacks on the roster combined. Overall, five expected defensive starters are 24 or younger. That number could jump to six if rookie Jermaine Cunningham wins the outside linebacker job. Contrast that with the offense, where the youngest starter could ultimately be 26-year-old Sebastian Vollmer. How big is the difference? The Patriots actually have a receiver on the practice squad -- 27-year-old Darnell Jenkins -- who is older than any defensive back on the team. The youth movement is not entirely restricted to defense. Promising tight ends Aaron Hernandez (20) and Rob Gronkowski (21) are the two youngest players on the team. The Patriots are also counting on a group of young receivers to emerge behind Randy Moss and Wes Welker. Those spots aside, the offensive side of the ball is full of graybeards. The defense is the clear question mark entering the season because of its youth and inexperience. But what factor could advancing age play on the offense? Tom Brady, Randy Moss and Fred Taylor all sit atop the Patriots' depth chart at their respective positions. But they have something else in common. All three are also at least 33 years old -- with Taylor (34) being the oldest player on the team. Throw in Alge Crumpler (32), and you can see why someone who pays attention only to fantasy football might think the Patriots are playing in a senior league. So can the Patriots succeed while aging at the three most visible positions on the field? It would certainly be historic. Consider this fact from the Elias Sports Bureau: No team in NFL history has ever had a leading passer, rusher and receiver who were all age 33 or older at the end of the season. Certainly, Wes Welker could have a bigger year than Moss. Or perhaps Laurence Maroney finally puts it all together in the backfield. But as things stand now, the Patriots are attempting something unprecedented. That's not to say Tom Brady is on the decline at 33. Common perception of Tom Brady's 2009 campaign suggests a down year -- and compared with 2007, what wouldn't be? Tom Brady's 75.9 fourth-quarter passer rating in 2009 was certainly a cause for concern, particularly since it fell to 52.4 when the game was within seven points. Compare that with Peyton Manning's 132.5 rating in the fourth quarter when a game was within seven. But was part of Tom Brady's struggles a reflection of strong opponents? When adjusting for the defenses that he faced, FootballOutsiders.com points to Tom Brady as the top quarterback in the NFL in 2009. Indeed, 33 doesn't qualify as old at quarterback. In fact, almost 30 percent (13 of 44) of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks were older than 32 -- although just five of the past 26. There have been 21 4,000-yard passing seasons by quarterbacks 33 or older. One-thousand-yard receiving seasons? There have been 50 by 33-plus receivers, which points to continued good production out of a receiver of Moss' caliber. But age doesn't impact each position equally, and for running backs, it's a different story. The wear and tear suffered at the position takes a toll as the years advance. Only five 1,000-yard rushing seasons can be attributed to running backs 33 or older -- and none since John Riggins in 1984. Here's the good news: The Patriots likely aren't counting on Taylor to carry the load by himself. They've retained the committee of running backs who combined to rank 12th in the NFL in rushing yards in 2009. But last season, Taylor was already the second-oldest running back in the game. Kevin Faulk was right behind him, and Sammy Morris was the fifth oldest. Aaron Stecker, the oldest in 2009, is now retired, while Ahman Green, the fourth oldest, is out of the NFL. That means the Patriots now have the three oldest running backs in the NFL. Combined, they are 101 years old. Those three elder statesmen currently top the depth chart. It seems probable that one will end the season as the yardage leader, although Maroney, who led the team in rushing in 2009, could re-emerge. To find a Super Bowl winner with a leading regular-season rusher older than 32, you have to go back to the 1990 Giants. Ottis Anderson -- the Super Bowl MVP -- was 33 years old in his final productive season. In fact, among the past 18 Super Bowl winners, only three have had a leading regular-season rusher who was 29 or older. There's a catch though: All three of those champions called Foxborough home.

The Packers' star cornerback had three years remaining on his current deal, meaning that Charles Woodson is now under contract with Packers for the next five seasons. \"What was key on this deal is that the team essentially made a three-year commitment to Charles Woodson where he can make over $33 million over the next three years. Overall it's a new five-year deal with a max value of over $55 million that has $21 million in advances and bonuses,\" agent Carl Poston told KDVR. And Charles Woodson wants to bring a championship to Packers before it's all over. \"I mean, we've got it here,\" Charles Woodson said. \"We've got the players to get it done. We've got the coaching staff to get it done. It's all going to rest on our shoulders, on the players to go out there and get it done. Our mission as a team is to get there and I think we can do it.\" Charles Woodson had three seasons left on his existing deal. But his standout play, combined with a recent new deal for Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, likely compelled the Packers to act. Packers coach Mike McCarthy doesn't see the 33-year-old Charles Woodson slowing down any time soon. \"He is in great shape,\" Mike McCarthy said. \"He really came into training camp in great shape. He looks like he did the last three years. Stay healthy, God willing, and he is instinctive and tough as they come, so I don't see any drop-off at all.\" He had a career-high nine interceptions last season and was the cornerstone of a much-improved defense under coordinator Dom Capers. \"I love the defense,\" Charles Woodson said. \"I can't say enough about playing in the 3-4 and playing for Dom Capers. All of those things combined brings us to this point. I'm very happy about this moment.\" Charles Woodson came to Packers as an unrestricted free agent before the 2006 season, but he wasn't enthusiastic about the move at the time. After publicly feuding with Raiders coach Bill Callahan, then missing most of the 2005 season after breaking his leg, Charles Woodson didn't have many other offers on the table. So he went to the Packers. He acknowledges that he didn't have a positive perception of the town or the team coming in, but he came around eventually. \"It was a gradual thing,\" Charles Woodson said. \"I think probably the more people that I met around here in the community and just throughout Wisconsin and just playing here with the guys that we have and the organization and the way they are with their players and the way they take care of their players, it was a gradual process. Once I realized what I had here in Packers, then it was a done deal from there.\" Today, he is known as a philanthropist -- he donated $2 million to the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital last year -- and is seen as a leader in the defense and mentor to young players. \"He's like a big brother to all of us,\" safety Nick Collins said. \"If he's getting a new contract, congrats, it's well-deserved.\".

No game was played, but there were potential life-altering events. The day started with a scary car accident in Boston's Back Bay that shook him up and had news helicopters circling Gillette Stadium filming his every move on the practice field. It ended with him signing a four-year, $72 million extension from 2011 to 2014 -- which also includes an unspecified amount of money in 2010 in the form of a signing bonus -- that positions him to play his entire career in Patriots. The events were unrelated as the contract had been at the goal line for a few days, ready to be punched through for the score. Still, it is only natural to connect them. What a whirlwind. On Wednesday, when Tom Brady was fielding questions about his long-term future in Patriots, he had talked about how he was taking a \"different approach,\" explaining that he now lives his life as though nothing is guaranteed in the future. He just wants to seize the day. Then came the car accident Thursday morning, which, had the timing been slightly altered, could have changed everything for Tom Brady. It's the type of stuff that had to send chills down his spine, especially since he didn't officially sign the contract, which had already been agreed upon, until later on Thursday. The Patriots are expected to officially announce the contract Friday. It is easily the richest deal in team history, and depending how contracts are defined by those analyzing them, will make Tom Brady either the highest paid player in the NFL or one of the highest paid. Few would argue that Tom Brady has earned every bit of the new deal. While it's easy to get bogged down in the contract figures, and compare Tom Brady's pact to others in the NFL to judge how it rates, the simple approach often works best in situations like these. In this case, Tom Brady has said he wants to play until he's 40 and this deal will take him to 37. Meanwhile, Patriots fans get at least five more years of Tom Brady leading the team. Tom Brady, whose three Super Bowl titles will ultimately have him enshrined in Canton, Ohio, will have played 15 seasons at that point. That's why Sept. 9, 2010 was a significant date for both Tom Brady and the stability of the franchise. Maybe in the coming days, Tom Brady will let his guard down and reveal what was going through his mind at the time of the car accident, when he was most vulnerable, and how the day ended with news of his contract set to become official, which represents the biggest form of long-term security a player can receive in a sport with little of it. Maybe we'll also find out about a major breakthrough in contract talks -- perhaps on a Cape Cod golf course one August day -- and some other revealing bits of information that led to this conclusion, such as whether there ever truly was a \"growing sense of disconnect\" between the sides. Through all the twists and turns, this was the anticipated ending: Tom Brady and the Patriots hitched for the next five years, and perhaps more after that. The final hurdle turned out to be one of the most unpredictable. A day that began with the team's fans concerned about the condition of a franchise icon ended with news that not only was he OK, but that he'd put his signature on a long-anticipated contract. It was surreal stuff, all the way around. Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPN Boston.

That's a mouthful about a man who doesn't have a full season of starting experience. Miles Austin's first catch of the season will be only the 100th of his career. Frankly, the Cowboys were much better informed about the player the last time they announced a lucrative extension. After all, outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware had been to three consecutive Pro Bowls and was well on his way to another. But let's not get too caught up in Jerryspeak semantics. The Cowboys made a wise move to lock up Miles Austin, ensuring that the 26-year-old will spend his prime with a star on his helmet. The Cowboys paid for Miles Austin's production last season, when he led the NFC in receiving yards (1,320) and finished fourth in the NFL in receiving touchdowns (11) despite not starting until Week 5, and the promise that the breakout campaign was a sign of things to come. The Cowboys' decision-makers are comfortable with that belief because of Miles Austin's character. \"Everything he's about would point to that he's not a one-year wonder,\" executive vice president Stephen Jones said. \"Whether it be his work ethic, whether it be that he's off the field a great person, a great leader. \"He's the anti-wide receiver. He's the anti-diva that you normally see with receivers. He's just not that type of guy. He's a hard worker, so you put that and then you actually see what goes on the field. \"We've got all the confidence in the world that he's going to perform year in and year out.\" That's clear by the contract. The Cowboys paid the market price for a premier wide receiver. Of course, that's the third time the Cowboys have paid a receiver that kind of money in recent seasons. They didn't get much bang for their buck on the previous two deals. But Miles Austin is a much different case than Terrell Owens and Roy Williams. T.O. had a history of being a team-wrecking prima donna. That's what ended up happening at Valley Ranch, where he basically declared war on Tony Romo and Jason Garrett, causing Stephen Jones to sensibly convince his father that the Cowboys would be better off without that drama. Roy Williams hadn't played a down for the Cowboys when he signed his five-year, $45 million extension days after arriving from Lions in a blockbuster trade. The Cowboys were banking that a change of scenery would help Roy Williams become the star they projected while scouting him at Texas before he was the seventh overall pick in the 2004 draft. They were wrong, as Roy Williams has underachieved even more in Cowboys than he did in Lions. Miles Austin has proved he can perform at a Pro Bowl level in this scheme and with this quarterback. He's never come close to creating any controversy. The only reason there is even a question about whether the Cowboys should have made this kind of financial commitment is because Miles Austin hasn't had sustained success. \"Yeah, he's only done it one year, but what a year,\" coach Wade Phillips said. \"It's not like the guy had a good year. He had a tremendous year and he had tremendous games that nobody's had before.\" Are the Cowboys taking a chance on Miles Austin? Of course, but it's a calculated risk. They know Miles Austin has the size, the speed and the skills to continue his ascent to superstardom. And they're certain the former undrafted free agent has the character to continue climbing. Miles Austin proved that with the way he worked during training camp, when other receivers in his contractual situation might have held out or mailed it in. \"He's what we want to build our franchise around,\" Jerry Jones said.

That's a mistake. Miles Austin agreed to a six-year contract extension Thursday worth $54 million. The deal calls for $18 million guaranteed. The other starting wide receiver on the Cowboys, Roy Williams, signed a five-year extension in 2008 worth $45 million with more than $20 million in guarantees. Earlier that year, Terrell Owens signed an extension with the Cowboys for $34 million over four years. You can argue that Terrell Owens is a locker-room diva and all that, but there is one thing you can't dispute: He's a proven player whom defenses must contain. This is not to say Miles Austin isn't deserving of the money. Who can complain about a player of Miles Austin's skill set making $54 million? But the Cowboys should have made him wait. They did so with his quarterback, Tony Romo. In 2006, Tony Romo saved the Cowboys' season and pushed them into the playoffs. He didn't get a new contract until the next season -- a six-year, $67.5 million deal. The Cowboys made Tony Romo work for his money and he rewarded the organization with one of his best seasons as a professional that year. Miles Austin made the Pro Bowl after catching 81 passes for 1,320 yards and 11 touchdowns last season. He was a physical force able to break tackles and outrun defenders when covered one-on-one in the slot. Last season, Miles Austin was 14th in the NFL with 707 yards-after-catch, and he led the league with 15 catches of 25 yards or more. All this after just 18 catches in three NFL seasons. But somehow Miles Austin broke through. The game against the Chiefs, which Roy Williams missed because of a rib injury, put Miles Austin on the map. Miles Austin set a single-game team record with 250 receiving yards in his first NFL start in a victory in Chiefs. It was the first time in NFL history that a player picked up 250 receiving yards in his first start. \"When you look at Miles Austin now, that Chiefs [game] might have been one of the greatest games anybody's ever played in the National Football League,\" coach Wade Phillips said. \"We're glad we've got him, and I know he'll continue to do well. He made a certain impact last year and I think he's going to continue.\" For all the uncertainty surrounding Roy Williams, there should be some surrounding Miles Austin. He has to prove he can perform at this level again. Defenses will employ a Cover 2 scheme, in which a safety covers Miles Austin along with a cornerback to make sure he doesn't make plays deep down the field. Cornerbacks will press him, forcing Tony Romo to find other receivers -- in this case rookie Dez Bryant, tight end Jason Witten and Roy Williams. Miles Austin's numbers should go down. Right? \"People have a whole offseason to study him, therefore there are going to be some new wrinkles,\" receivers coach Ray Sherman said. \"Some new things we haven't seen before. We just have to be ready to adjust and adapt.\" That's the problem. If Miles Austin doesn't adjust and produce big numbers or have an impact on the offense, whether it's by making catches or opening the door for others, it would appear the Cowboys made a mistake. The Cowboys can't afford any more mistakes, moneywise, with their wide receivers. They took a $9 million cap hit in 2009 to let Terrell Owens go, and you can't get more than a few people to believe in Roy Williams' abilities when matched up to his contract. In 25 games, Roy Williams has just 57 catches. Miles Austin had 81 last year. Miles Austin doesn't believe in predicting the future because it wastes everybody's time. You never can tell what the next year will produce. And it's that uncertainty that raises questions about giving Miles Austin the money now. If he has a strong September, great. Give him the money. Waiting a few more weeks is not going to hurt anything. \"I don't know about anybody else, just because you responded in a certain situation doesn't mean you might choke the next year,\" Miles Austin said. \"You never know what's going to happen. For me to predict something is crazy. It's whatever happens in that day.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.

Michael Crabtree, the second-year 49ers receiver, will start his first season opener Sunday at Seahawks. He didn't join the team until October last year following a 71-day contract stalemate by the 10th-overall draft pick in 2009.

It's nothing.\" Michael Crabtree has enough to worry about considering he hasn't played yet and many are already wondering whether his timing with quarterback Alex Smith will be affected come Sunday at noisy Qwest Field. Michael Crabtree made his NFL debut in 49ers's sixth game last season at Texans. He finished his rookie campaign with 48 catches for 625 yards and two touchdowns, then impressed the coaches and Alex Smith with his work ethic during the offseason. He hurt his neck leading up to the 49ers' exhibition opener at Colts and was limited mostly to individual work in practice when he did take part after the injury. Offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye said Thursday he is concerned about Michael Crabtree's stamina once in a game. \"He hasn't played at game speed in any of the exhibition games,\" Raye said. \"And even though a year ago he was not here, he was conditioning. This time, he was here but not getting any conditioning. There's a different tempo from not playing and not practicing to going in to play. That would be my concern at this point. I think he'll do OK with the terminology, the system in the game. It's just how quickly we can get to where he's not maxed out and exhausted.\" Michael Crabtree doesn't think that will be an issue. \"I'm not worried about nothing,\" he said. \"I'm just worried about getting all my plays in in practice, really going out there and playing. I'm getting really tired of talking about what's going to happen. We just need to go out there and play.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5551266", "Entities": ["Michael Crabtree", "Vernon Davis", "49ers", "Seahawks", "Mike Singletary", "Chargers", "Alex Smith", "Texans", "Colts"]}, {"title": "Bills shelve LB Kawika Mitchell", "author": null, "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The Bills placed linebacker Kawika Mitchell on injured reserve Friday, ending the seven-year veteran's season two days after he hurt his foot in practice. \"Unfortunately Kawika had a lot worse of a problem than we had anticipated,\" Bills coach Chan Gailey said. \"It was going to be quite a few weeks, and we just couldn't wait.\" Chan Gailey added that it was too early to tell if Mitchell would need surgery to repair the problem.

The deal includes $18 million in guaranteed salary, sources told ESPNCowboys.com's Calvin Watkins. Miles Austin signed a $3.168 million contract in June. Miles Austin's extension is worth $54 million, bringing the total value of his contract to $57 million. \"He's going to be around here a long time,\" Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said during a teleconference announcing the deal. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had repeatedly said the Cowboys wanted to sign the receiver coming off a breakout season to a long-term deal. That finally came Thursday, three days before the season opener at Redskins. \"My career started here, you guys gave me a shot and obviously I put my all out there every day,\" said Miles Austin, who was pulled out of offensive meetings for the unexpected yet unsurprising announcement. \"It feels great to be wanted by this team because I want to be here.\" In his first career start last October at Chiefs, Miles Austin had 10 catches for a team-record 250 yards and two late touchdowns, including the 60-yard game winner in overtime. He broke the single-game yardage record held by Hall of Fame receiver \"Bullet Bob\" Hayes since 1966. That was quite a breakout performance for Miles Austin, who entered that game with 23 career catches, including five in the first four games last season. Yet, he wasn't a one-game wonder. His encore was six catches for 171 yards and two more TDs in Cowboys' next game. He went on to earn a spot in the Pro Bowl by finishing the season with 81 catches for 1,320 yards, sixth-best in team history and the sixth-best by any undrafted receiver ever in the NFL. The Cowboys certainly don't anticipate the 26-year-old receiver from tiny Monmouth College in New Jersey to be only a one-year wonder either. \"We all are familiar and admire the way Miles has evolved into the player he is today. We're also very impressed with the person that he is,\" Stephen Jones said. \"I've never felt like when we have made this kind of commitment to any individual that we've ever been as prepared or better informed about what he is as a player and as a person. That's a good feeling and made this very comfortable in terms of getting this done. \"He's what we want to build our franchise around,\" Jones said. The Cowboys already had quarterback Tony Romo, who like Miles Austin came into the league as an undrafted free agent, signed to a long-term contract along with linebacker DeMarcus Ware, tight end Jason Witten and nose tackle Jay Ratliff. All are Pro Bowl players. Stephen Jones said it was important to get Miles Austin's deal done before the start of the new season, though he said \"it happened in short order\" once negotiations really began after the team returned from training camp in Oxnard, Calif., about two weeks ago. \"The big thing we needed to do was just get our hands around all the uncertainties that are out there,\" Stephen Jones said, referring to pending NFL negotiations with the players' union. \"At the end of the day we knew were going to have Miles and we were going to figure out how to make that work.\" Coach Wade Phillips said Miles Austin continued to work hard during the offseason and into preseason workouts even though the contract situation had to be on his mind. And the coach isn't concerned about Miles Austin's quick ascension from virtual unknown to Pro Bowl player with a long-term contract in less than a year's time. \"I am confident in Miles. Yeah, he's only done it one year, but what a year,\" Wade Phillips said. \"He's shown so many things. He had the greatest game in Cowboys history. That's pretty strong. It's not like a guy who just had a good year. He had a tremendous year, and he had tremendous games that nobody's had before. I think that's part of the confidence. \"He's such a hard worker, he is a great athlete and he's learned how to pull it all together. I think that will continue.\" Miles Austin is the third high-profile receiver to receive a lucrative extension this offseason, behind Dolphins wide receiver Brandon Marshall and Texans wide receiver Andre Johnson. Also, Colts' Reggie Wayne and Eagles's DeSean Jackson each have been lobbying for new contracts.

Take Rams middle linebacker James Laurinaitis, who in 2009 became just the second rookie in Rams history to lead the team in tackles ( Pisa Tinoisamoa in 2003 was the other). Ever since his high school days in Plymouth, Minn., he's kept a three-ring binder that contains charts and analysis on every play he's ever studied on film. Now, as the quarterback of the Rams defense, the 6'2\", 250-pound James Laurinaitis relies on catalogs of knowledge -- written and mental -- more than ever. Why? Most Mike linebackers are given the team's in-helmet communicator so they can receive and relay the play calls. The Mike also is the one defender who's supposed to be in on every tackle: stuffing the run from sideline to sideline, blitzing from any of six gaps across the line, shadowing shallow pass routes by tight ends and backs, and covering the deep middle seam in the Cover 2. In other words, before James Laurinaitis can put his physical skills to use, the second-rounder from Ohio State must first process and disseminate an avalanche of information. No wonder his weeks begin with film study, game-planning and note-taking on Monday morning. His intel gathering peaks six days later, a millisecond before each snap, when he runs through his presnap reads: down and distance; \"keys\" -- clues on the play to come based on personnel, formations or tendencies; field position; game situation; team morale, etc. If, somehow, you could see his in-play thoughts like bubbles, you'd see multiple checklists swirling above the field as he spins and churns through multiple inputs (the movement of the line, the tells of the QB, the eyes of the running back) before locking into a single course of action (attack, shadow, drop back). Ultimately, every game is a chance for James Laurinaitis to draw from his three-ring binders -- and to add to it for the next one. To see how that process works, here are the five moments from James Laurinaitis' rookie year that opened his eyes and made him say a-ha.

But, quite frankly, so do the front offices in this league. Think about it: The average NFL career lasts about 2\u00bd years. In the NBA, guaranteed rookie contracts for first-round picks last longer! Because of performance issues, the constant pressure on coaches to find solutions so they can spare their own jobs and the inevitability of injuries, the league churns through players at a remarkable rate, and it always will. Throughout the season, I'll look at NFL storylines and point out the things I'll be watching closest in terms of personnel as I review all the tapes. This week, it's about quarterbacks. Namely, these are the guys I'll be watching closely based on where they stand with their organizations and what that could mean for the future. Anytime you get \"anointed\" without much of a track record, the pressure's on. But in the case of Henne -- who I absolutely think deserves the starting nod, so don't get me wrong -- the situation is even more pressing because of the way the team has been constructed for a quarterback to succeed. The running game is there with Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams behind a well-built offensive line with a remarkable talent in Jake Long on the left side, and now the long-battered receiving corps is no longer an excuse.

Early IDP sleepers to watch", "author": "Jim McCormick", "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "He's out there, just waiting for you. To be honest, there are probably several of them out there: the unearthed gems that will go onto to sway fantasy seasons. Every campaign has its crop. Last season, the offensive side of the ball saw the likes of Miles Austin and Jamaal Charles ascend to fantasy stardom, with our side enjoying the works of David Hawthorne and Bernard Pollard. Instead of waiting for these soon-to-be-desirable free agents to emerge, let's speculate on which widely available defensive talents have the potential to fortify your roster. It's a lot cooler to have the breakout talent before he even breaks out, right? Given that I didn't get you a sleepers and rookies report this preseason, let me lay down some of the lesser-coveted commodities I've been pursuing in my many IDP leagues so that you can begin to target, and even acquire, some of these promising players. Peruse this week's Front Four for a variety of different players to target and consider. Rated Rookies (linebackers): We're not talking about Donruss'88 classics here, rather, the promising crop of rookies going unnoticed in fantasy leagues. The Raiders' imposing Rolando McClain is getting some love in IDP circles (not enough, mind you), but several impact talents remain in this freshman class. Two promising linebackers, the Cardinals' Daryl Redskins and the Falcons' Sean Weatherspoon, secured starting gigs on their respective defenses and are both in good positions to produce a nice blend of numbers, with Redskins's inside role for the Cardinals being distinctly favorable. Rated Rookies (linemen and secondary): The somewhat undersized but adequately motivated Brandon Graham has been talking and playing a good game so far the Eagles and gets a crack at a Packers offensive line that should still have some protection issues. Fellow Eagle Nate Allen locked down a starting safety gig in Philly, which historically has been a very productive perch from a statistical standpoint. Don't forget the Seahawks Earl Thomas, who under the tutelage of Lawyer Milloy, should blossom into quite the playmaker. More rooks will emerge, no doubt, but consider these names worthy of consideration. Middle Men: The most consistent producers in most any format are middle and inside linebackers, particularly \"mike\" linebackers in a traditional 4-3 scheme. If a \"sleeper,\" by definition is an under-recognized talent who bears considerable upside, then look no further than the man who is taking over for one of the most prolific fantasy producers. If you can, acquire the Panthers' Dan Connor. This \"Linebacker U\" (Penn State) product took over the middle once Pro Bowler Jon Beason shifted to the outside on account of Earl Thomas Davis' unfortunate injury. We won't be expecting Jon Beason-like production from Dan Connor, but triple-digit tackles and a handful of turnovers are well within reason for this season. The Giants' Jonathan Goff won the statistically bountiful role manning the middle for Perry Fewell's downhill scheme and is literally absent in fantasy leagues, as in 0 percent ownership. This will change as the next few weeks play out. Leftover Legends: People rarely doubt what Bob Sanders can do on a football field. The reservations emerge from his inability to stay on the field. That said, he's supposedly healthy and ready to lead the Indy secondary (if not the entire defense). For a blend of tackles, deflections and turnovers, Sanders can likely be yours for just the click of a plus symbol, considering that he's available in over 70 percent of ESPN leagues. While he doesn't share the same injury history as Sanders, Champ Bailey has struggled with injuries over the past few seasons and his fantasy stock has depreciated substantially. Back in the lineup for a vastly underrated Broncos secondary, the widely available Champ Bailey makes for a compelling addition for leagues that specifically roster cornerbacks, and is even worthy of consideration as a general defensive back in the right format. The Chiefs' Derrick Johnson has never truly been a fantasy star, but he was at a time a very relevant option, and he now returns to prominence as a starter over Demorrio Williams in a role that is incredibly favorable for tackle production. The Giants will surround the young Jonathan Goff with veterans Keith Bulluck and Michael Boley, both of whom merit greater consideration on the market. So that we're working from agreed parameters, we'll use what many consider traditional scoring modifiers for an IDP league: Tackle - Solo (0.5), Tackle - Assist (0.25), Sack (3), Interception (3), Forced fumble (3), Fumble recovery (3), Touchdown (6), Safety (2), Pass defended (1), Blocked kick (2). Keep an eye on Antrel Rolle, a productive but gambling safety for the Giants. He's being underappreciated and once he makes some big plays for a big market team he won't be so easy to acquire. As thin as the defensive line positions are both in real football and particularly in fantasy, it should be noted that the Jaguars' Aaron Kampman has a Pro Bowl pedigree and faces a Broncos team that will pass early and often. Make sure to have some depth ready if you own the Bengals' Antwan Odom, who recently tested positive for banned substances but will play this weekend against the Patriots. The Giants' Mathias Kiwanuka, for example, provides great Odom insurance, or simply merits replacing him if you want to move on from his situation. Give his penchant for floating between outside linebacker and defensive end in his Dolphins days, Jason Taylor is tabbed as an end, which provides a significant boost to his value as he should see considerable snaps with fellow tweener Calvin Pace out with an injury. The aforementioned David Hawthorne is holding down an outside'backer spot in Seahawks and makes for a great play in deeper leagues for as long as he can hold off the currently-suspended Leroy Hill.

Odom wasn't available Friday during the team's open locker room period. Coach Marvin Lewis said there was no change in the status of the appeal. \"It's something that's been ongoing for a while,\" Marvin Lewis said. \"Obviously a couple guys played last night [in the Saints' 14-9 win over the Vikings] who have been through that who are still playing.\" Although he didn't meet with the media on Friday, Odom acknowledged on his Twitter account that he tested positive for a banned substance. He denied reports that his four-game suspension is for using performance-enhancing drugs. \"Yes, I tested positive for a banned substance but it wasn't steroids or [performance-enhancing drugs],\" Odom tweeted. \"More details to come but for now it's a league issue that's under appeal. Just know that I would never cheat to gain an edge in this game that I love.\" Two years ago, Bengals linebacker Darryl Blackstock got a four-game suspension for using a performance-enhancing substance. Blackstock said one of his nutritional supplements included an ingredient banned by the league. The NFL could deny Odom's appeal and force him to miss four games, or reduce the penalty. Losing Odom would be a significant setback to Bengals's pass rush. The 28-year-old lineman led the team with eight sacks when he tore his right Achilles tendon only six games into last season. He still led the team in sacks for the season despite his injury. He has fully recovered from the injury. Odom missed time during training camp because of an illness and a sore knee, but is expected to rejuvenate a defensive line that made pressuring the quarterback a priority this season. The Bengals signed Odom as a free agent from Titans in 2008, their major offseason acquisition to help the defense. A foot injury limited him to eight starts and three sacks in his first season with the Bengals. Last season, he emerged as one of the NFL's best at getting to the passer. He has seven sacks in the first two games, an NFL record. He was tied for the league lead when he tore his Achilles Oct. 18.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5554689", "Entities": ["Bengals", "Patriots", "Marvin Lewis", "Saints", "Vikings", "Titans"]}, {"title": "Channing Crowder questionable vs. Bills", "author": null, "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "DAVIE, Fla. -- Dolphins linebacker Channing Crowder is listed as questionable for Sunday's opener at Bills, meaning he's considered 50-50 even though he has been sidelined since Aug. 17 because of a groin injury.

It is the pinnacle of a career for an NFL player. \"You dream about it as a kid, you think about it all season long -- that's your goal coming in -- and you finally you get there,\" said Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher, who played in Dolphins's Super Bowl XLI. \"So it was an all-time high getting there -- and an all-time low when we lost.\" Ah, the dreaded Super Bowl hangover. The Bears scored two touchdowns in the first quarter but ultimately fell to the Colts 29-17. And there was clearly a carryover the following season. The Bears, who were 13-3 over the 2006 regular season, finished 7-9, fourth in the four-team NFC North. Pain. A sensitivity to light and noise. Nausea. Remorse -- all symptoms of too much, uh, fun. \"In a matter of hours you're going from thinking you're going to win to [being] at the bottom of the barrel,\" Brian Urlacher said. \"It's disheartening. You got there and you're kind of expected to get back to the next year and you don't.\" Brian Urlacher still has some mementos from the game, including the cleats he wore. They are covered with flakes of the confetti that was released when the Colts won. Historically speaking, the Bears are not alone. Far from it. No fewer than seven of the past nine Super Bowl losers couldn't even make the playoffs a season later -- and six of those teams failed to reach.500. and combined for a record of 38-58. Only two teams in the Super Bowl era lost the championship game and returned a year later to win it -- the 1971 Cowboys and the 1972 Dolphins. This is really just a long-winded way of saying: Watch out, Colts. Colts and Peyton Manning, you may remember, lost Super Bowl XLIV to the Saints in Dolphins -- the very place where they won three years earlier. There may be some enduring effects when the Colts kick off their 2010 regular season against the Texans. \"You see your opponent on TV and all the different commercials and everything they're doing or receiving their Super Bowl trophy and getting their rings and everything,\" Colts defensive back Melvin Bullitt said. \"It's like you missed the whole season. I don't want to say it was for nothing, but you know we have one goal and you know we just didn't accomplish it. It kind of lingers with you.\" Said Colts pass-rusher Dwight Freeney : \"Losing in the Super Bowl is very painful. I think this is something that you never really ever forget. You're anxious, next season, [to] move on with it, but I think it kind of stays with you.\" The Colts will be a good test for the Hangover Theory, because they have been ludicrously and consistently competitive, making the playoffs for eight straight years. Bill Polian, architect of the Colts, recently told the Colts Star emphatically, \"There's no hangover. There's no carryover.\" The ESPN.com Power Rankings are on board; the Colts are the number 1-ranked team for Week 1 -- ahead of the team that beat them in Dolphins. But if history means anything, the Colts -- who won 14 straight games a year ago -- will be swimming upstream. Take the Patriots, for example. They went 16-0 over the 2007 season, but after losing to the Giants 17-14 in Cardinals, they were 11-5 and failed to make the playoffs. The first five Super Bowl losers of the millennium (Giants, Rams, Raiders, Panthers and Eagles) all had losing records the next season. Why? There are myriad reasons. Perhaps the most important is the NFL's egalitarian approach to scheduling. The biggest winners get the toughest schedule. This alone can account for a drop-off. But factor in two more things: Opponents are more fired up to beat you. \"You're already a target after that year, you know, when the power rankings come out,\" Bears linebacker Lance Briggs said. \"Everyone knows who the top teams are and it's not easy, not easy.... And maybe, just maybe there isn't quite the sense of urgency for the team that's been there [and done that].\" \"I don't know if the expectations are so high that you can't live up to them, or if there's so much pressure on you -- but we didn't play well the next year,\" Brian Urlacher said. \"I mean, guys just expect to be there, maybe take a little bit easier next year.\" There are often contract squabbles in the wake of a Super Bowl run, a scramble to get paid. Sometimes there is finger-pointing over what went wrong. This can only hurt team chemistry. Playing into February can also put you four or five weeks behind other teams when it comes to postseason surgeries and injury rehabilitation. The other thing the Colts must keep an eye on is the health of Peyton Manning. Five of the recent Super Bowl also-rans lost their quarterback in the next season's campaign, four of them to injury. Colts has been bullish on protecting Peyton Manning, who has started all 16 games for 12 consecutive seasons; he's started 192 straight regular-season games, second to Brett Favre's mark of 286 regular-season consecutive quarterback starts. (The NFL does not count postseason games in official records.) It's been well more than three years since the Bears lost to the Colts in Dolphins, but Bears head coach Lovie Smith has yet to sit through a replay of the entire game. \"I know the ending,\" Lovie Smith said. \"You're not really interested in the ending. It's been three years since we've been in the playoffs. You take for granted that each year you'll be back there. But now looking at it, you see how hard it really was, and how hard it is of course to get back. \"To come back after you lost I've heard about the Super Bowl jinx hang[ing] over for the team that lost and all of that. I just know that we talked about it and said that we were going to be the ones to be another part of that statistic, but [for] some reason it happened.\" Colts linebacker Gary Brackett said he hoped that losing in Dolphins will make the Colts stronger. \"Winning the Super Bowl would have been nice,\" he said, \"but we still got there and, honestly, it's going to drive us more this season. No one expected the Saints to ever win a Super Bowl. The Colts, we've always won and we've always been one of the best teams. \"We put that aside, and we move forward.\" Greg Garber is a senior writer for ESPN.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=5547471", "Entities": ["Bears", "Brian Urlacher", "Dolphins", "Colts", "Cowboys", "Peyton Manning", "Saints", "Texans", "Dwight Freeney", "Patriots", "Giants", "Cardinals", "Rams", "Raiders", "Panthers", "Eagles", "Lance Briggs", "Brett Favre", "Lovie Smith", "Gary Brackett"]}, {"title": "Marc Colombo, Kyle Kosier won't play", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "IRVING, Texas -- Starting right tackle Marc Colombo and starting left guard Kyle Kosier will miss the Cowboys' regular-season opener against the Redskins on Sunday night. \"It doesn't look like they're going to play,\" coach Wade Phillips said Friday.

I certainly enjoy that, my association with Tom. Those things he brings, I believe in. I think he believes in some of the things I believe in, so that helps.\" Tom Brady's contract is worth $72 million and guarantees him $48.5 million, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The extension, which will be filed with the league Friday, will be added onto the final year of Tom Brady's contract and runs through 2014, when he will be 37. Tom Brady, 33, has said he wants to play until he's 40. Tom Brady, who was picked by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 draft, is making $6.5 million this season in the final year of an earlier four-year, $48 million extension. The new deal will make him the league's top-paid player in terms of average annual salary. Tom Brady walked through the locker room when reporters were present Friday, but declined to speak about his extension. He also did not answer questions about the car accident he was involved in on Thursday morning. Although both Bill Belichick and Tom Brady were mum on the new deal, owner Robert Kraft wasn't shy when commenting to ESPNBoston.com on Friday afternoon. \"We're really excited that we have one of the finest players playing the game at the helm of our team for the next five playing seasons,\" he said. \"It's sort of a continuation of a cycle. We started with Vince Wilfork, then Tully Banta-Cain, Leigh Bodden, Stephen Gostkowski. We've secured some pretty good players. \"This one [with Tom Brady] was complicated and we committed in an uncertain environment given the labor situation. Both sides felt it was the right thing to do, and sometimes you show real leadership when doing the right thing.\" Wide receiver Wes Welker, one of Tom Brady's favorite targets, said Friday of Tom Brady's deal: \"Nobody deserves it more. I'm happy for him,\" he said. \"It's probably been a long process. I'm happy he's here for a long time.\" Wes Welker said there has been no noticeable change over the last two days. \"He is still the same Tom to us,\" he said. \"We're still going to razz him and give him a hard time about all the money he's made, and everything like that, and tell him why he's not dressed better. Sometimes he slacks in that area.\" Asked how many dinners it might cost Tom Brady now that he has the new deal, Wes Welker laughed. \"He always [paid for] them before,\" he said. \"[He] definitely [will] now.\" Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPNBoston.com.

Their first-game performance suggested they needed more practice. After a sluggish 14-9 defeat at Saints, the Vikings returned home with a mix of frustration and confidence. Their biggest concern has to be the offense, which was able to move the ball remarkably well in the second quarter to take a halftime lead but stalled after that once they strayed from the run. \"There's no way we're up to the warp speed of an 18th game of the season,\" coach Brad Childress said Friday afternoon. He added: \"It's a work in progress on offense. It's from a number of different spots, just getting your center back, your wideouts or your quarterback. We need to get up to speed in a heck of a hurry. I believe we will.\" The missing-from-action list last month was no secret, and it was long. Brett Favre gave in to the begging and came back for his quarterback job, but not until Aug. 17. His favorite wide receiver, Sidney Rice, needed hip surgery and won't return for another month or two. His next-favorite target, Percy Harvin, had another major migraine headache attack and missed dozens of practices. Starting center John Sullivan had a lingering calf injury that kept him out for most of the preseason. Sidney Rice's replacement, Greg Camarillo, came in a trade on Aug. 25 and is still getting up to speed with the playbook and his new teammates. \"It's obvious we could be a lot better,\" Brett Favre said after the game, while taking a lot of the blame for the lack of productivity that netted only 253 yards. He also delivered a telling comment that served to sum up his -- and others' -- absence from two-a-days: \"I thought our timing was a little bit off.\" In the first quarter, for instance. Percy Harvin was in the right slot, covered by linebacker Marvin Mitchell, and the Vikings had first-and-10 at their 41-yard line. The pass called was a \"basic cross,\" according to Childress, one of their favorite plays. Brett Favre's throw, unlike several others throughout the night, was strong and in the right place. Percy Harvin, however, didn't run it right. \"He beat his guy, and he kind of lulled and settled as opposed to running through the throw,\" Childress said. Brett Favre targeted Percy Harvin five times, but he caught only one pass for 12 yards. Camarillo, Bernard Berrian and Greg Lewis had one reception apiece. Tight end Visanthe Shiancoe was the lone productive piece in the passing game, as Brett Favre finished 15 for 27 for 171 yards, one touchdown and an interception. \"I didn't see him tricking his feet out or anything,\" Childress said, downplaying the effect of blitz pressure brought by the Saints. \"I thought by and large there were pretty clean pockets. You could probably do a better job of wiggling people open schematically.\" On other subjects: \u2022 Childress said that, despite having only four wide receivers on the active roster, he's not thinking about adding another one. \u2022 Childress said Camarillo will probably be more involved as the season progresses. The Vikings host his former team, the Dolphins, on Sept. 19 in their next game. Camarillo could also replace Bernard Berrian as the punt returner, after an unimpressive performance in that role. \"Not that I'm uncomfortable with Bernard. I think Camarillo would do just as well. That would probably be a week to week decision on who we have back there,\" Childress said. \u2022 Rookie cornerback Chris Cook will test his injured right knee in practice on Monday, but playing against the Dolphins is another issue. \"I know how he's progressing in the training room and on land, but to play the game is a whole different thing,\" Childress said. \u2022 Husain Abdullah started at safety over Jamarca Sanford and Tyrell Johnson, but Childress said it's still an open competition. \u2022 Brett Favre went to Mississippi after the game for the christening of his grandson.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5556054", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Saints", "Brett Favre", "Sidney Rice", "Percy Harvin", "John Sullivan", "Marvin Mitchell", "Bernard Berrian", "Visanthe Shiancoe", "Dolphins", "Chris Cook", "Husain Abdullah", "Jamarca Sanford"]}, {"title": "Russell Okung still out with ankle sprain", "author": null, "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "RENTON, Wash. -- Seahawks rookie left tackle Russell Okung is already out for the season opener against 49ers. He might not be ready for Week 2 either. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said Friday that Russell Okung's status is still unknown as he tries to return from a high ankle sprain suffered in Seahawks's second preseason game. Russell Okung was hurt on Aug. 21 against Packers on the first play of the game when he got tangled with guard Ben Hamilton. He's been a spectator at Seahawks practices ever since. \"We're going to try and do more with him next week. We'll try to run him next week,\" Pete Carroll said. \"He's done a great job in rehab and he is real anxious about it, as you can imagine. We'll see where he is next week.\" Russell Okung was taken with the sixth overall pick in the April draft and instantly inserted to take over at left tackle for the retired Walter Jones. Russell Okung was then late reporting to camp as contract negotiations on his six-year $58 million deal dragged through the first week of training camp. Russell Okung managed just three plays in his second preseason game. \"It'll be a day to day process until we know more.... With that kind of injury, until you really have to push off with it and load it up do you know how a guy's responding,\" Pete Carroll said. \"We might not even be able to know that next week, so we'll see how it goes.\" Filling Russell Okung's spot has become a complicated process. Seahawks used converted guard Mansfield Wrotto for its final two preseason games, only to cut Wrotto last weekend as the roster was trimmed. The Seahawks also traded a conditional draft pick to Lions to get Tyler Polumbus, who played for offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates in Broncos and finally got Chester Pitts back into practice as he continued recovering from microfracture knee surgery. Bates said on Thursday that Tyler Polumbus was likely to start on Sunday against 49ers but a day later Pete Carroll said it would be a game-time decision between Pitts and Tyler Polumbus. \"[Pitts] practiced enough to be ready to play in this game. Tyler did a really good job also so we're in really good shape there,\" Pete Carroll said. \"It's important that we do this right with Chester and we bring him back when he's healthy and ready to go for the long haul.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5556363", "Entities": ["Seahawks", "Russell Okung", "49ers", "Pete Carroll", "Packers", "Lions", "Tyler Polumbus", "Broncos"]}, {"title": "Pro Bowl lineman Kevin Mawae retires", "author": null, "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The president of the NFL Players Association said he got one offer from a team this year. It came too late, and Kevin Mawae said Friday he decided being with family was more important than his passion to keep playing in the league. The veteran offensive lineman announced his retirement from the NFL after 16 seasons and eight Pro Bowls in a news conference while standing in front of banners for the union and LSU, across the street from Vanderbilt University, where he has been working as a strength and conditioning intern. A framed LSU jersey with Mawae's college number 52 stood to his left, a present from Tigers coach Les Miles who's in town for a game Saturday night. \"My brother reminded me I have nothing to prove nor do I have anything to lose in this decision,\" an emotional Mawae said. \"I've done everything an NFL player can want to do except winning a championship. With that, I walk away from the NFL on my own terms and with the only regret that of not being a Super Bowl champion.\" Mawae played for Titans last season, starting all 16 games and helping block for Chris Johnson as he ran for 2,006 yards. The starts gave Mawae 241 regular season games played, at that time the most among active linemen. He missed only three starts, in his rookie season with Seahawks. But his contract was up, the Titans went younger with Leroy Harris to replace Mawae, who turns 40 in January. He finished his career playing in his final Pro Bowl. He will serve out his term as union president, which ends in March 2012. Mawae felt his role as union president, with the league and union in the final year of their labor deal, limited interest in him. \"I'm the only... Pro Bowler in the last two years not on a roster right now. It doesn't take a brainiac to figure that out,\" he said. He did get a call from a team he did not name. Mawae said he discussed the issue with his agent, his wife Tracy and his pastor. But he said the mental wall players build to block out the physical aches and pains was down, and he didn't want to be separated from his 13-year-old son or 10-year-old daughter. He used a tissue from his daughter as he cried at times. \"I don't like to hurt. It hurts to get out of bed in the morning. It hurts to walk upstairs. As a player, an active player, you block those things out. When you're not involved in the game, that wall comes down, and it's too hard to build that wall back up,\" he said. Mawae first was elected president of the players union in 2008 and was re-elected to the two-year post in March. He had been on the union's executive committee since 2000 and was a players' representative between 1998 and 2000. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell saw Mawae before the league's opener Thursday night in Saints and congratulated Mawae on an outstanding career. Goodell noted in his statement Mawae was one of only two centers in NFL history to play in eight Pro Bowls. Elias Sports Bureau found the late Mike Webster played in nine. \"We salute Kevin and look forward to working with him as president of the NFL Players Association to get a Collective Bargaining Agreement that protects and enhances our great game,\" Goodell said. According to Elias, Mawae's 211 starts at center were third behind Ray Donaldson (228) and Jeff Van Note (225) since 1970. Titans left tackle Michael Roos was on hand along with Leroy Harris and Titans linebacker David Thornton, the team's player representative. Michael Roos said earlier he thought his friend could have kept playing. \"He's one of those guys that the league will be a little more somber not having him here,\" said Michael Roos, who still has Mawae's number 68 practice jersey hanging in his locker. A four-year starter at LSU, the 6-foot-4, 289-pound Mawae was drafted in the second round in 1994 by the Seahawks and also played for the Jets before landing with the Titans in 2006. Mawae earned his first Pro Bowl berth in 1999 with the Jets, after blocking for Curtis Martin, who ran for 1,464 yards. He snapped his streak of playing in 177 consecutive games in October 2005 when he hurt his left triceps, knocking him out of the final 11 games. He signed with Titans where he spent the final four seasons of his career, helping the team to two playoff berths as part of an offensive line that allowed an NFL-low 12 sacks in 2008. He missed the two playoff games with injuries.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5553716", "Entities": ["Titans", "Chris Johnson", "Seahawks", "Leroy Harris", "Saints", "Michael Roos", "Jets"]}, {"title": "Saints-Vikes scores record ratings", "author": null, "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "NEW YORK -- The NFL is off to a strong start in its TV ratings after drawing big numbers last season.

That, and a desire to add at least one more victory to my season-record prediction after watching the Vikings, Thursday night. I am also reminded of the sage words of Bears head coach Lovie Smith as he stepped under the Olivet Nazarene gazebo for the first time this year and told us, \"I know what a good football team looks like. This is a good football team. Every week, everything will take care of itself.\" He was right on one count. Every week, everything will take care of itself. The great majority of the time, the Bears will win if they deserve to win and, let us not forget, vice versa. That's usually how it works. And as much as we think we know what to expect from the season, each week will provide new clues and clear-cut answers to what will indeed unfold. The Lions game Sunday should tell us significantly more than we know now. But it will not tell us whether the Bears are a good football team. Though the Lions should be much-improved, they are not expected to roll into Soldier Field with a great offensive line and a reliable secondary. The Lions' offense, like that of the Bears, is hopeful at best. It's hopeful that second-year quarterback Matthew Stafford will continue to mature; that the addition of number 2 receiver Nate Burleson will make Calvin Johnson more dangerous; and that first-round draft pick Jahvid Best will make defenses honest. I'm excited to see Julius Peppers in a real game. I'm dying to see how the Bears use him, what kind of support he receives up front and relieved that head coach Lovie Smith finally broke down and made the call at the other end spot and that we won't have to see Mark Anderson and Israel Idonije skip onto the field hand-in-hand for the Bears' first defensive series. Lions head coach Jim Schwartz said stopping Julius Peppers (seven sacks and three forced fumbles in four career starts against the Lions) will be a priority, but made it sound more like the priority. \"It's going to be not just our front five,\" Jim Schwartz said, \"it's going to be our quarterback, it's going to be our tight ends, our running backs and it's also going to be our receivers being able to get open.... That's a one-on-one matchup, but it's more than just a one-on-one matchup.\" I am also more than a little curious to see how Brian Urlacher responds with a calf injury that kept him out of the final two preseason games and cut significantly into his practice time. Having built up a healthy bit of skepticism regarding Bears' injuries over the years and seeing how Brian Urlacher's absence seemed to affect his team last season, every twinge is worthy of our attention. Meanwhile, rookie safety Major Wright, sidelined for half the preseason by a broken left index finger, said this week he was \"full go\" for Sunday. The level of enthusiasm among media and fans to that news tells you all you have to know about our confidence in the rest of the Bears' secondary. Moving Major Wright into the lineup at free safety would probably not create any real adjustment for Chris Harris, who is more comfortable on the strong side. Strong safety Danieal Manning will likely shift back to nickel in place of D.J. Moore. But that might just be moving the proverbial deck chairs with an unproven rookie counted on to pick up all the slack for a unit largely responsible for the Bears' preseason woes on third down. All the more reason Jay Cutler and the Bears' offense must deliver on their promise to show us wonders we can only imagine. If Jay Cutler can escape veteran defensive end Kyle Vanden Kyle Vanden Bosch, he will still have to contend with rookie tackle Ndamukong Suh, who has already been fined for tossing around Browns quarterback Jake Delhomme in an unkind manner. \"His hype is well deserved,\" Bears center Olin Kreutz said of Ndamukong Suh. But how about the hype Mike Martz's offense? Though he has consistently improved the passing offense of teams with which he has worked, he has not automatically made them winners. Now is when we will find out not just if Martz means what he says but if he has said what he meant. Will Matt Forte and Chester Taylor be utilized enough to keep them both effective and difference-making? Will Greg Olsen simply become a receiver? If so, is there enough room on the field, considering the Bears will need another tight end to help block. Bears receivers insist good things are ahead and they should continue to improve. \"We definitely held some things back,\" Devin Aromashodu said of the preseason. \"We're focusing on our opponents now.... I think there will be some surprises. We know what we're capable of so we won't be surprised, but maybe fans will be.\" Jay Cutler said game week has been a lot more intense and detailed. \"It's a totally different ballgame right now,\" he said. \"Mike is one of those game-planners that gets a great feel for defenses and is able to call plays when there's a high probability of getting the right defense.\" Of course, the right play doesn't mean a whole bunch if the quarterback is running for his life. \"That's why we have Mike Tice here,\" Jay Cutler said. \"Mike is very sensitive to the issue of quarterbacks getting hit. We've talked about it many times. A lot of our stuff is timing. The ball is supposed to be out. And if everyone is doing their job and Mike [Martz] is giving us good plays, then the ball should be gone.\" If and when the play breaks down, however, Jay Cutler assures us he's going to go. \"I'm not just going to sit in there and take a sack,\" he said. I wonder if the Bears, frankly, are tough enough after another soft camp under Lovie Smith. And I wonder how long it will take for the discussion to focus on the coach's fate even though Lovie Smith will not be going anywhere if there is a lockout. Bears management is simply not going to pay two coaching staffs to play golf. And so I am curious. And I am excited, just as I am for every NFL season. But optimistic? Brian Urlacher said it would not be \"the end of the world\" if the Bears lost to the Lions on Sunday. And Jay Cutler said it was \"not a bad thing\" that the Bears are going into the game \"under the radar.\" Perhaps in the big picture. But not in Bears, Jay. Never in Bears.

As soon as the Jets were done eating mid-practice cheeseburgers and rushing out of the trainer's room and into makeup for their weekly reality show, the Giants were listening in silence to a Jersey-born fan who served as commanding general of the United States forces in Iraq. In full camouflage before the huddled Giants on Thursday, Gen. Raymond T. Odierno related their teamwork to that of the soldiers who captured Saddam Hussein. Sure, it's a worldwide stretch to compare the capture of a murderous dictator to the need to contain Steve Smith. But as far as life lessons go, it sure beats lunch with Darrelle Revis' agents at the Roscoe Diner, or Rex Ryan starring in the role of Lenny Bruce. \"You won't ever be seeing us on'Hard Knocks,'\" Giants co-owner John Mara said. \"It's just not our style. \"I do find it amusing that the media just flocks to the Jets' headquarters to get the latest quotes. In actuality, it's the perfect scenario for us. We always seem to perform our best when we're under the radar and let our play do the talking. I don't think I could've scripted it any better.\" When the Giants open the 2010 season and New Meadowlands Stadium on Sunday, they won't be facing only the Panthers, an antagonist with a history of humiliating them in the regular season and playoffs. The Giants will also be competing against an invisible opponent, an adversary fixing to seize the marketplace and to do it with as much commotion as possible. Jets coach Rex Ryan will be the elephant in the room. No, the Jets aren't on the regular-season schedule, and no, Giants coach Tom Coughlin and QB Eli Manning aren't interested in stealing away the HBO parts granted Rex Ryan and Mark Sanchez. But truth is, the Giants have been blasted into obscurity by the blustering Jets, so used to playing the Mets to the Giants' Yankees before Rex Ryan and his outsized personality barged through the saloon door. So after the Jets reached the AFC title game, and after the Giants finished an 8-8 season punctuated by two gutless performances, Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning need to make themselves relevant again. They need to reclaim their field, their superiority, their long-standing rank as the lead team in a two-team town. \"It was embarrassing go out there and get handled like that the last two weeks of the season,\" said Giants GM Jerry Reese, whose team was outscored 85-16 by the Panthers and Vikings. Those defeats inspired Mara to deliver a rare public rebuke of his Giants, to make like Rex Ryan in a team meeting, minus a four-letter word or three. The 55-year-old co-owner said he was \"probably as disappointed as I've ever been in my life at this team,\" declared that the 8-8 season felt like a 2-14 season, and warned, \"I'm not pleased with anybody right now.\" Mara took last season personally for a reason: His grandfather purchased the Giants for $500 in 1925. Football is his business, but it's also his blood. That blood boiled after the Giants defaced their doomed stadium and their doomed season. If Mara didn't mean to put Tom Coughlin and Reese on immediate notice, didn't mean to make 2010 a win-or-else proposition for the men who had won him an epic Super Bowl, his words sure left that impression. \"My style isn't to be bombastic,\" Mara said, \"but I was angry and I think our fans were angry, too. I think they needed to hear from me that I wasn't content with the season, but a lot of that was directed at the players. \"When you lose two games like that, I don't know how you can't be embarrassed. But we're moving ahead now. I like the makeup of this team.\" Eli Manning has grown into the Giants' undisputed leader; he was voted a captain for the fourth consecutive year. Upon finishing practice Thursday, the quarterback went straight to the workout room, dropped down on his back, kicked his feet in the air, and held a large weight in his outstretched hands as he repeatedly lifted his torso off the mat. Eli is never going to win any body beautiful contest, and that's just fine. His extreme value to the Giants revolves around his ability to stay on the field, the NFL's most important skill. Now Reese wants Eli Manning to expand his game and take the entire team by the throat. \"We'll have a talk this week,\" the GM said, \"and my thing is,'Not only are you the leader of the offense, you should walk on the defensive end, too.' Eli usually stays on his side of the ball during the game, but I expect him to go to the other side of the ball and say,'It's OK guys, just get us the ball back and we'll get it done.'\" Can the Giants win it all this year? Probably not. But they should be good enough to contend for the division title, make the playoffs, and take their chances in the tournament. They should be good enough to knock their neighbors back onto the lower-rent side of the fence. \"We need to re-establish ourselves as a power in the NFC,\" Mara said. \"If we do that, it won't matter to us how many games the Jets win.\" Or how much profanity Rex Ryan uses when they lose.

Matt Slauson does not expect it to be an easy debut. \"I just got to know what to expect, I know they're going to be coming after me because they consider me the weak point now in the line,\" Matt Slauson said. \"But it's my job to not just win the starting job, it's to play at the same level as Nick [Mangold] and D'Brickashaw [Ferguson] and Brandon [Moore] and [Damien] Woody and all those guys so I've just got to study and prepare and get it done.\" Mangold, the Jets center, said it will be a high-profile moment, but that's not a bad thing. \"It is going to be difficult for him but I think you want that as a player, you want that on your shoulders, you want to prove that you know what you're doing,\" Mangold said. \"And I'll be there as a guiding force as best I can.\" Matt Slauson was vying with second-round draft pick Vladimir Ducasse for the left guard spot that opened when the Jets cut Alan Faneca. Matt Slauson's biggest moment of training camp might just have been during the second preseason game of the year, when his missed block led to a sack that came dangerously close to Mark Sanchez's surgically repaired left knee. Nonetheless, his linemates think Matt Slauson will be fine. \"I think he's ready; preseason is preseason,\" Woody said. \"Everybody wasn't crisp in the preseason but he has been working hard at this all offseason. He's been waiting for this moment so I have all the confidence in the world in Matt Slauson and his ability to go out there and perform at a high level.\" Matt Slauson came to the Jets by way of Nebraska, where he was recruited by Jets offensive line coach Bill Callahan. Callahan recommended Matt Slauson to Rex Ryan during the sixth round of the 2009 draft. Matt Slauson has the advantage of many years in the current system and one year under Alan Faneca, who is now playing for the Cardinals. The move to cut Alan Faneca stunned some fans. Former quarterback Joe Namath, who came out during the first week of training camp in Cortland, arrived full of praise for Mark Sanchez but was so preoccupied with the offensive line that several questions led back to the same point. \"I'm more worried about our left guard position than I'm worried about anything,\" Namath said. \"The offensive line is a major factor in letting the offense produce.\" As a high pick, Ducasse was expected to put up more of a fight, but he was ultimately too raw. He may not have won the job this time, but the rookie with the prototypical LG frame will be looking to improve as the season goes along. \"Right now I've just got to keep working hard,\" Ducasse said. \"That's what I can do, that's what I can say right now.\" Matt Slauson will be flying his parents in for the game, so they can see him play in front of a sold out New Meadowlands Stadium and a \"Monday Night Football\" viewing audience. \"It's a dream come true being able to play on the best offensive line in the NFL,\" Matt Slauson said. \"I couldn't be more pleased right now.\" Jane McManus is a columnist for ESPNNewYork.com.

Join the ever-expanding club, Ray. Managing to out-talk the trash talkers, the Ravens linebacker unloaded Thursday on Rex Ryan, Darrelle Revis and Mark Sanchez, suggesting the Jets -- Rex Ryan, in particular -- yap too much for a team that hasn't won anything. \"We're talking about the Jets like we're talking about the Saints,\" Ray Lewis told reporters in Ravens. \"Those are the only people that can be dethroned: Drew Brees and the Saints, not Mark Sanchez and the Jets.\" Earlier, on a conference call with the New York media, Ray Lewis said his former defensive coordinator, Rex Ryan, is making it tough on his team by delivering brash predictions. \"The only danger is writing a check you can't cash,\" Ray Lewis said. \"That's pressure on his players. Rex can talk all he wants to, but Rex ain't putting on the pads.... At some point, you put that bull's-eye on your head. They're doing all this talking, like they're in the Super Bowl. OK, do what you do, but come Monday night, the whistle is going to blow and somebody is going to get hit.\" On Monday night, the Jets and Ravens meet at the new Meadowlands stadium in what Rex Ryan described as \"a game people will remember.\" It's the season opener, but it's also open season on the Jets. In recent weeks, Tony Dungy, Rodney Harrison, Tom Brady and Terry Bradshaw have criticized the Jets for their big-talking, hard-knocking attitude. Rex Ryan claimed his bravado puts the pressure on him, not his players, because he's the one making the bold statements. As for Ray Lewis, whom he called the greatest linebacker he's ever coached, Rex Ryan said he took no offense to the remarks. \"It doesn't matter what he says in a negative light, because I still respect him,\" Rex Ryan said. \"But we're going to try to smash him, I can tell you that much.\" Most Jets players took Ray Lewis' comments in stride, although some thought it was funny that he compared the Ravens to the Los Angeles Lakers. That came in response to cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who compared the Jets to the Dolphins Heat. \"If y'all are the Dolphins Heat, we've got to be the Lakers, because we're looking for multiple rings,\" Ray Lewis told the Ravens media. It has been 10 years since the Ravens won the Super Bowl, a not-so-small fact that seemed to undermine his Lakers analogy. That prompted some snickers in the Jets' locker room. Of course, the Jets have gone 42 years without a title, but they talked Super Bowl all summer -- and that was before Darrelle Revis ended his holdout. With Darrelle Revis back, they feel whole, raising the confidence needle to an all-time high. That's fine by Ray Lewis. \"I'm glad he signed, so there are no excuses,\" he said. \"Don't come and say,'Oh, we didn't have Darrelle Revis.' Have everybody y'all need to have. Whoever y'all need to sign, bring them out of retirement, whatever you need to do.... Stack your deck and let's play football.\" Ray Lewis seemed chagrined by all the attention Darrelle Revis has received. \"Darrelle Revis puts his pants on one leg at a time,\" he said. \"He's not a machine. He's a simple man, and he has to deal with everything we're willing to bring to the table as well. Hopefully, he's ready to play. Hopefully, his 35-day layoff didn't hurt him. \"But we don't need no hope. Y'all can keep your hope because we've got enough hope over here. We're packing our bags, and we're not packing our bags to come play water polo.\" Ray Lewis also took aim at Mark Sanchez, claiming he \"struggles\" when the Jets' running attack is slowed and he's forced to throw. Rex Ryan took issue with that, claiming his second-year quarterback plays well in big games. This is all hot air, of course -- meaningless talk. On Monday night, talk is cheap. \"I know he doesn't like us,\" guard Brandon Moore said of Ray Lewis. \"I know he wants to bash our heads in. That's nothing new. We feel the same way about him.\" Rich Cimini covers the Jets for ESPNNewYork.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=5550547", "Entities": ["Ray Lewis", "Jets", "Ravens", "Rex Ryan", "Darrelle Revis", "Mark Sanchez", "Saints", "Drew Brees", "Tom Brady", "Antonio Cromartie", "Dolphins", "Brandon Moore"]}, {"title": "Time to welcome Gang Green to reality", "author": "Rich Cimini", "date": "Sep 10, 2010", "content": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- It hangs on the far wall of the Jets' cavernous field house, high above the playing field -- a 30-foot picture banner of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. It's a new addition to the facility, a reminder of what was -- see the \"1968\" tag -- and what can be. What will be, according to Rex Ryan, who expects to add \"2010\" to the banner in due time. \"Everybody expects us to be a great team,\" he said, \"and we expect to be a great team ourselves.\" Starting Monday night, the team with the big talkers, big expectations, bigger-than-life coach and really big stadium will strut to the center of the stage. America's cable-TV stars will face the Ravens in a rock'em, sock'em football game at the New Meadowlands Stadium, and it's going to be crazy. And different, but not because they have new digs, a $1.6 billion metal and cinder-block palace. No, it will be different because the Jets have gone from Rudy to Rowdy, the team everybody loves to hate. The Jets brought it on themselves, and now they have to deal with the consequences. They're wanted. It's a most unusual position for a franchise that hasn't achieved championship glory in 42 years, but last season's playoff run, coupled with a big and brash offseason, has raised expectations to an all-time high. It's Super Bowl or bust and, in their minds, bust isn't allowed in the stadium. (Maybe the PSLs are too expensive.) This is the Jets' most important season opener in a long time, a wonderful opportunity to validate themselves as a legit team, worthy of the headlines. Are they hot air or the hot heir to the Colts in the AFC? Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis made his feelings known this week, basically saying the Jets are unworthy of the hype. ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski named the Jets as one of the most overrated teams in the league, saying, \"They were a 9-7 team a year ago. Many people have them picked for the Super Bowl. Only time will tell if they continue to improve.\" Fellow ESPN analyst Jon Gruden believes the Jets added a \"bevy of outstanding players,\" but he wants to see how it comes together. As for the bravado, he called it \"elevator music... I don't think it offends anybody or stimulates any team, but I do think they have a lot to prove.\" Now it's proving time. It's time for Mark Sanchez to prove his mediocre preseason was an aberration and that he really is the quarterback who matured last January. The Ravens' secondary, sans safety Ed Reed, is an inviting target. A poised quarterback, with the help of a clever offensive coordinator, should be able to figure out ways to probe the secondary and find the weak spots. Time for LaDainian Tomlinson, 31, to prove he's still got it, and that the front office didn't blow it big-time by shipping leading rusher Thomas Jones out of town. Time for Jason Taylor, another sure-fire Hall of Famer, to prove that 30 other teams were wrong about him. After being discarded by the only other team he ever loved, the Dolphins, Taylor, 36, received only one free-agent nibble -- the Jets. Time for Matt Slauson to not be Adrien Clarke, the overmatched scrub who was handed the left-guard job when Pete Kendall was unceremoniously traded in 2007. The Jets gave Alan Faneca a Kendall sendoff, jeopardizing the chemistry on a wonderful offensive line. Time for Antonio Cromartie to prove he's not the player he was in 2008 and 2009, and it's time for Nick Folk to prove he's not the kicker who was run out of Cowboys last season. There are questions, to be sure, but the Jets have an impressive collection of talent. They also have a very good coaching staff, but the landscape has changed. They're not going to surprise opponents anymore. Some teams act differently when they're a favorite. Some get out of their comfort zone and forget the things that made them successful. The Rex Ryan Jets were built on defense and a ball-control offense, same as the Ravens, who are showing signs of becoming more versatile on offense. It would be a mistake for the Jets to suddenly morph into a passing team, especially if it becomes obvious that Mark Sanchez isn't ready for the promotion. It's a delicate balance. The Jets believe they're special in all areas, but are they as good as they think? \"If you want to win, you ought to be man enough to stand up there and say we expect to win,\" Rex Ryan said. \"I've got news for you: We expect to win this week, next week and every week.\" In case they forget, they have a 30-foot mission statement hanging from the wall.

The first game matches Shonn Greene against Ray Rice, while the second game pits Jamaal Charles against rookie Ryan Mathews. How do these young backs compare with other backs of the past 30 years? To find that out, we decided to play with a fun toy called similarity scores. Similarity scores were introduced by Bill James to compare baseball players to other baseball players from the past, and the idea has spread to other sports. We have a version we use for the NFL (which you can read more about here). This isn't a perfect measurement by any means -- because similarity scores compare standard statistics like yards and touchdowns, they are subject to all kinds of biases from strength of schedule to the quality of each player's offensive line. Nevertheless, they're fun to play with and they tell you a little bit about whether a player is good, bad, or just unique. Of course we can't do similarity scores for a player who has never taken the field in the NFL, so Ryan Mathews will have to wait, but here's a look at Monday night's three other young running back stars.

We have a lot to be thankful for. It was really a miracle.\" Kraft's initial concern for Tom Brady on Thursday ultimately led to relief, and later, Tom Brady's contract becoming official. \"We have a saying that out of bad things good things can happen if managed properly. It put in perspective everything we're doing,\" Kraft said. \"We're very, very lucky. Patriot Nation is lucky he had his seatbelt on.\" Kraft said his and the team's thoughts are now with 21-year-old Ludgero Rodrigues, who according to a police report was driving the van that struck Tom Brady's car, as well as the 49-year-old passenger who was hospitalized. Authorities are backing off claims that Rodrigues had previously been arrested for driving under the influence. A spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter told the Boston Globe on Friday that someone else had impersonated Rodrigues when he was arrested last year. Prosecutors dropped charges against the 21-year-old after he convinced authorities that he was not the person they detained last year. As for the contract agreement with Tom Brady, Kraft was predictably thrilled about striking such an important deal. \"We're really excited that we have one of the finest players playing the game at the helm of our team for the next five playing seasons,\" he said. \"It's sort of a continuation of a cycle. We started with Vince Wilfork, then Tully Banta-Cain, Leigh Bodden, Stephen Gostkowski. We've secured some pretty good players. \"This one [with Tom Brady] was complicated and we committed in an uncertain environment given the labor situation. Both sides felt it was the right thing to do, and sometimes you show real leadership when doing the right thing.\" Kraft, who had played golf with Tom Brady on Cape Cod in early August, was asked if there was a breakthrough in talks at any point that sealed the deal. \"I really think it was a process,\" he said. \"In any deal like this, there is an ebb and a flow.

He just wants to be included in the club. On Friday, two days before the defending AFC champs open the season in Texans against Andre Johnson and the Texans, Reggie Wayne used a lighthearted approach to make a more serious point about his own situation. \"This offseason we were talking about contracts,\" Reggie Wayne said. \"Once he got his done, I texted him'congratulations,' and the first thing he asked me was,'So what's up with yours? What are you going to do?' I texted him'absolutely nothing.' At least somebody's getting paid. I'd also like to send congratulations out to Miles Austin. He got paid.\" In August, Andre Johnson signed a two-year extension that could pay him up to $38.5 million. Miles Austin signed a six-year deal reportedly worth $54 million to stay in Cowboys on Thursday. Meanwhile, Reggie Wayne, who is second on the Colts' career list for receptions and yards receiving and third in TD catches, is playing out the final two years of a six-year, $39 million deal he signed four years ago. So Reggie Wayne wants to redo his contract. \"It's either we'll get something done or we're not. We haven't had any talks. I can read in between the lines, I know what's going on,\" he said. \"But I'm not going to let that affect my production. Like they say, it's a business, right? So I'm going to treat it like a business. I'm going to do what I'm supposed to do. And that's go out there and make plays.\" Reggie Wayne skipped all of Indy's team workouts this spring, including a mandatory three-day mini-camp in June, in hopes of getting a new contract. It didn't work, and when training camp opened, Reggie Wayne showed up on time. \"I thought about it [holding out], but it's bigger than me,\" Reggie Wayne said on Aug. 2. \"I had already let my teammates down once.\" Colts President Bill Polian has said that it's unlikely anything can be completed now because of the uncertain labor situation. NFL owners and the league's players association are trying to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement before next season. And the Colts' top contract priority is Peyton Manning. His $98 million deal expires after this season, and team owner Jim Irsay has said he will make Peyton Manning the league's highest-paid player. That value was established Thursday night when Patriots quarterback Tom Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract. But Reggie Wayne won't be far behind Peyton Manning in the pecking order after posting his second 100-catch season in 2009 and a sixth straight 1,000-yard season. He's been to the Pro Bowl each of the last four years and the Super Bowl twice in that stretch. What Colts fans will remember, though, is the ball he didn't get in the Super Bowl -- the one Tracy Porter ran back 74 yards for the game-sealing touchdown. Reggie Wayne acknowledged he was upset for a couple of weeks, but a little time on the beach helped him get over it. \"That's football, man, that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't say it didn't bother me. But I like the direction we're headed.\" And he's ready for some football. \"I feel great, man,\" he said. \"I'm not going to say I feel like I'm 20. Maybe 21 would be more accurate. But we've got some guys around here to keep me feeling young. I feel great, and I'm ready to play.

He is hoping that the foot injury doesn't keep him from being considered as a punt returner for the team. At least with his current injury, he is able to practice and is seeing improvement. \"In the beginning it was really difficult. I couldn't put my heel down. I couldn't plant,\" Aaron Ross said. \"But this week I've been doing a lot day by day -- 50 percent the first practice, 75 and the whole practice today. I've felt really good. It's getting better and better every day, and I still have two more days, so don't count me out.\" The Giants saw injuries to a dozen or more key players during training camp, but most have come far enough to be available for the first game of the season. Other than Aaron Ross, Gerris Wilkinson (groin) is questionable, but Phillip Dillard (hamstring) is out. Corey Webster (groin) will be back. Aaron Ross suffered the injury Aug. 25 in a preseason game against Steelers, and his foot was placed in a hard cast. He said he didn't notice the injury until he came off the field. \"I cut off the tape and that's when I realized my heel was a little painful,\" Aaron Ross said. \"I'm pretty sure it wasn't the tape job. It was probably the way I planted it. I just didn't feel it until I took the tape off.\" On Friday, Aaron Ross said he was able to jump and sprint, and everything felt good. \"As a football player we play in pain all the time,\" Aaron Ross said. \"So if it's just pain, then I'll be ready for Week 1, but if it's still injured and I hurt the team, then once again I can't make that decision.\" Jane McManus is a reporter and columnist for ESPNNewYork.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=5555413", "Entities": ["Giants", "Aaron Ross", "Tom Coughlin", "Panthers", "Corey Webster", "Steelers"]}, {"title": "10 areas to watch in Pats-Bengals", "author": "Mike Reiss", "date": "Sep 11, 2010", "content": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Ten areas that project to be crucial in Sunday's game between the Patriots and Bengals: 1. Stopping Cedric Benson and the run. The Patriots figure to be in their 3-4 alignment, with new starters at left defensive end ( Gerard Warren), right defensive end ( Mike Wright), inside linebacker ( Brandon Spikes) and left outside linebacker (projected to be Rob Ninkovich). That changes the \"fits\" in the run game, which has to be a concern for the Patriots given the Bengals' bigger offensive line and success running the ball. 2. Young corners vs. Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens. Rookie Devin McCourty and second-year player Darius Butler are expected to start, and it's a tough assignment in lining up against veterans Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens. If the Patriots can consistently generate a pass rush -- which hasn't been a strong suit -- it would be a big help as they should be expecting the Bengals to take some shots down the field. 3. Pass protection in spread formations. With a full complement of weapons to utilize in the passing game, the Patriots figure to spread the field in an attempt to challenge players like Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga and safety Roy Williams, who are best cast as run-defenders. As is always the case, whenever a team goes with a spread look, it lessens the number of players staying in to protect, and that highlights the importance of keeping quarterback Tom Brady's jersey clean. 4. Wes Welker's return to action. Arguably the top question facing the team at the start of training camp was when Wes Welker might be ready to return to the field from early February surgery to repair his torn left ACL. Stunningly, it is now off the radar because Wes Welker isn't even on the injury report. When it's third down and the Patriots need to move the sticks, Wes Welker has traditionally been Tom Brady's favorite target. 5. Bengals corners vs. Randy Moss, Wes Welker & Co. Although they weren't as consistent as expected during the preseason, Bengals cornerbacks Leon Hall and Johnathan Joseph are still a formidable duo. Opposing wide receivers totaled just nine receiving touchdowns against the Bengals last season, so Moss, Wes Welker and the others face a significant challenge in crossing the goal-line. 6. Safety play and matching up against Jermaine Gresham. The Bengals' rookie tight end creates some matchup issues, making it harder to play with two safeties protecting the deep half of the field. Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather played a team-high 95 percent of the snaps last season, but based on recent practices, it wouldn't be surprising if his action is limited in favor of a James Sanders /Patrick Chung tandem on Sunday. 7. Tight end Rob Gronkowski in the red zone. The Patriots' second-round draft choice tied for the NFL lead with four touchdowns in the preseason and has been a primary target for quarterback Tom Brady in the red zone. At 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, his presence becomes that much more important when the space gets tight inside the 20. 8. Running back Fred Taylor and first-down gains. Because of the Bengals' attacking, penetrating style of defense, staying out of long-yardage situations takes on added importance. That's why Taylor's ability to avoid negative runs on early downs will be important against a well-distributed defensive line that is sturdy across the board. 9. Kickoff and punt return game. Both teams were excellent in the preseason. In a game that projects to be close, likely coming down to the critical situations in the fourth quarter, a big return that shifts field position could very well be the difference. The Patriots are counting on second-year receiver Brandon Tate in that role. Bengals punter Kevin Huber had a strong preseason, leading the AFC in net average (41.2). 10. Exploiting Bengals' pass protection. This will be one of the biggest offensive lines the Patriots face this season, but it's also a unit that has struggled at times in pass protection. Outside linebackers Tully Banta-Cain and Rob Ninkovich, and defensive lineman Mike Wright should have opportunities to pressure quarterback Carson Palmer, which will be important to help out a young secondary.

NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith asked the Saints to vote on the strategic procedure when he met with the team in Saints. The Saints voted on the issue Monday. The union will send a memo to its approximately 1,900 members Monday to inform them of the strategy that is being described as a housekeeping step. Contacted Saturday afternoon by ESPN, Smith downplayed the importance of the Saints' vote and the anticipation that all 32 teams will eventually take the same action. \"To be dead honest, it's purely procedural and I believe it's a non-story until March,\" Smith said. \"It preserves the best options to protect players in the event there's no deal in place when the CBA expires next March. Instead of scrambling at the 11th hour to get all our players' signatures [for decertification], we'll have everything in order. Our hope is that it's not necessary.\" A union source said NFLPA officials are scheduled to meet with three or four teams this week, including the Cowboys, Eagles and Redskins. The union expects to complete the process with all 32 teams by Thanksgiving. Under decertification guidelines established by the National Labor Relations Board, the union would no longer be able to represent the players in collective bargaining. It is an action the union took that enabled individual players to seek antitrust lawsuits against the NFL and eventually provided the leverage that led to a new era of free agency in 1993. On the NFL players association website in 2008, NFLPA general counsel Richard Berthelsen warned of the potential union action to prevent the NFL from locking out players in 2011. \"The NFLPA would sooner go out of business as a union,\" Berthelsen said. \"This is not just a threat, it's a reality because we did it once before.\" Chris Mortensen is ESPN's senior NFL analyst.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5558815", "Entities": ["Saints", "Cowboys", "Eagles", "Redskins"]}, {"title": "Brodney Pool unlikely for Jets' opener", "author": "Ian Begley", "date": "Sep 11, 2010", "content": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- From all indications, it looks as if Jets safety Brodney Pool won't play in the team's season opener Monday night against the Ravens. Brodney Pool has yet to complete a full practice since he sprained his left ankle in the Jets' 16-11 exhibition loss to the Redskins on Aug. 27. He is listed as questionable by the team. Rex Ryan said Saturday that the team is deciding between playing Brodney Pool on Monday night -- and putting him at risk to aggravate the injury -- or sitting Brodney Pool to give him a chance to return to the field completely healthy. \"He's almost at that point, where [we say],'Do we push him through it and risk him [having a] more longer, nagging injury? Or do we give him a little time off so he gets to one hundred percent?' \" Rex Ryan said. \"That's what we're weighing right now.\" Brodney Pool sat out of drills during the portion of Saturday's practice open to the media. The safety said afterward he still feels a stiffness in his ankle that limits his ability to cut and change direction. \"I feel better than I felt then when I first did it [but] it's going to come down to Coach's [decision],\" Brodney Pool said, adding that the stiffness needs to subside before he feels \"comfortable enough to cut on it.\" The 26-year-old Brodney Pool said he injured his ankle when a player fell on it during a fumble recovery against the Redskins. The Jets signed Brodney Pool in the offseason to replace departed safety Kerry Rhodes. In theory, the hard-hitting Brodney Pool is a better fit than Kerry Rhodes for Rex Ryan's blitz-heavy defense. Brodney Pool, who played five years in Browns before signing with the Jets, was limited to 11 games in 2009 due to a concussion. Reserve safety Eric Smith likely would start in Brodney Pool's place Monday night against Anquan Boldin and the Ravens. \"It's one of those things that's probably a game-time decision but I'm preparing like I'm the starter right now,\" Eric Smith said.

Tom Brady's contract is worth $72 million and guarantees him $48.5 million, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The extension, which will be filed with the league Friday, will be added onto the final year of Tom Brady's contract and runs through 2014, when he will be 37. Tom Brady, 33, has said he wants to play until he's 40. Tom Brady, who was picked by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 draft, is making $6.5 million this season in the final year of an earlier four-year, $48 million extension. The new deal will make him the league's top-paid player in terms of average annual salary. \"We've gone about our business in a diligent manner with very complicated, difficult labor environment,\" team owner Robert Kraft told the Boston Herald on Friday. \"We've been able to secure Tom Brady, Vince Wilfork, [Stephen] Gostkowski, [Leigh] Bodden, Tully Banta-Cain, people who have come here, worked hard and want to be here long term. We've done everything we can do. \"While our job is never done. I sort of like this team over the next few years. We have a great coach, and one of the finest quarterbacks to have ever played the game for another five seasons.\" Sports Illustrated's Peter King broke news of the agreement during halftime of NBC's broadcast of the NFL's season-opening game between the Saints and Vikings, saying he spoke to Kraft, who told him the deal was finished. The agreement comes on the same day Tom Brady was involved in a two-car accident near his home in Boston. He walked away from the crash uninjured and practiced with the Patriots in the afternoon. It's unlikely the accident had any impact on the deal's completion Thursday, but Tom Brady wanted to get the contract finished before Sunday's season opener against the Bengals. After all, it was two years ago when Tom Brady's season was ended in the first quarter of the first game when Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard rolled into Tom Brady's knee, tearing his ACL. \"You count your blessings when you come off the field,\" Tom Brady said Wednesday. \"I think you have a new appreciation when you do come off the field, win or lose. You're trying to win every time out, obviously. But I think you also pinch yourself every time you walk off the field healthy and say,'Man, at least I get a chance to go out next week and play also.' \" Tom Brady's extension has been the hottest topic of the summer in Patriots, although Tom Brady downplayed its importance even as reports surfaced that his relationship with the team had become strained. \"I really love being here and playing for Mr. [Robert] Kraft and Jonathan [Kraft],\" Tom Brady said Wednesday. \"Our relationship isn't based on how much money he pays me.'I'm great when he pays me what I want, and I hate him when....' I mean, that's not the way relationships work. \"I've had friends like that in the past. That's not the type of friends you want. It's very unconditional -- the relationship I have with coach [Bill] Belichick and the whole organization. I'm blessed to play here and I love playing here. I think we're all fortunate to play for a team that's committed to winning. If that's the goal for all of us, if you want to win, you really appreciate where you're at.\" On Wednesday, when reports indicated an extension was close, Tom Brady sidestepped contract questions, saying his focus was on preparing for Sunday's season opener. \"The reality is I have a job to do and my job isn't revolved around worrying about what my future is right now,\" he said in an interview on Boston sports radio station WEEI. \"My job is to be the best leader for this team that I can be, and really to get ready to play the Bengals, and play really well. Because of that, I think it's pretty selfish if I sit here and that's all I'm worried about -- myself.\" \"I have never been comfortable talking about my contract,\" Tom Brady said in a statement Saturday, \"and certainly didn't want discussions of my contract negotiations to serve as a distraction to any of my teammates as we have been preparing for the Bengals and the start of the 2010 season.\" Tom Brady isn't the only Patriots player entering the final year of his contract. Wide receiver Randy Moss is also in the last year of his deal and said recently he feels \"not wanted\" by the Patriots. Offensive lineman Logan Mankins is also unhappy with his contract situation. The Pro Bowl guard has refused to sign his contract tender and has not been with the team since the end of last season. Peyton Manning is in the final year of a seven-year, $98 million deal ($14 million average), and Colts owner Jim Irsay said he intends to make his quarterback the NFL's highest-paid player. Tom Brady threw for 4,398 yards last season with 28 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. For his career, the two-time Super Bowl MVP and three-time champion has 225 touchdown passes and 99 interceptions.

You're united. You're one union, one voice. Now enough already with the over-dramatic, inappropriate and yawn-inducing \"we're oppressed\" pregame show of solidarity. It'd be one thing if NFL players were fighting for their livelihoods, for basic medical coverage or pension benefits. But they're not. They're making more money than ever. So are NFL owners. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady just signed a $72 million deal ($48.5 million guaranteed). Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis recently agreed to a four-year, $46 million contract ($32 million guaranteed). 49ers 49er Vernon Davis is now the highest-paid tight end in the history of the game, thanks to a five-year, $37 million extension ($34 million guaranteed). Nothing personal, but the last thing I want on my football Sunday, Monday or Thursday is a reminder of labor unrest. I want the NFL, not the NFLPA. I want an escape, not a negotiations seminar. You want to march onto the field, poke your forefingers in the air and act like you work in a Philippines sweatshop? Then do it on your own time. Nobody who pays thousands of hard-earned dollars for those rip-off personal seat licenses comes to games for labor demonstrations. I'm not anti-union. I'm anti-publicity stunt. And that's all this was -- a well-intentioned but silly public gesture that will have zero impact on future negotiations. Seriously, do you think the owners curled into the fetal position when they saw those raised forefingers before the Vikings-Saints game Thursday night? They rolled their eyes, that's what they did. And you don't see the owners stomping out of their stadium suites before the game, defiantly clinking their champagne flutes with each other as a sign of togetherness. Anyway, you're either united or you're not. It's a like that line in \"A Few Good Men,'' where Tom Cruise's Kaffee tells Dawson: \"You don't need a patch on your arm to have honor.\" Same with the players. You don't need a finger schtick to have unity. Not only is the gesture ill-conceived, it's ill-timed. The season in jeopardy is 2011, not 2010. We're a YEAR away from that first regular-season kickoff and six months before the possibility of a work stoppage reaches true critical mass. But the players, in an effort to project strength, draw a line in the turf with the pregame finger thing. Would it be nice, as NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith has said, to have an agreement in place by this November? Sure. Nobody -- the players, the owners, the fans, the TV networks, fantasy leaguers, the people whose livelihoods depend on games -- wants an NFL-free 2011. But stunts like this aren't going to bring the two parties to the negotiating table. Distilled to its purest greed form, this latest dispute is about revenue sharing. NFL owners want to reduce the amount of money the players receive from the league's total revenue. The players, understandably, don't want to give back a penny. They don't trust the owners, and who can blame them? Until the owners open their accounting books, I wouldn't trust them either. Something has to give and hopefully it won't the be 2011 season. I'm rooting for sanity to prevail and for a deal that's fair to Longshanks and Norma Rae -- the sooner, the better. In the meantime, the players need to keep the posturing -- and the fingers -- to themselves. Gene Wojciechowski is the senior national columnist for ESPN.com.

Ravens offensive coordinator Cam Cameron told reporters in Ravens on Friday that he gleaned \"strategic\" information from watching the miniseries that chronicled the Jets' preseason. \"Yeah, there was probably a lot revealed in that strategically, the way I viewed it,\" Cameron said. \"At least what we were jotting down. There was a lot of stuff in there, strategically.\" Rex Ryan, who served as a coordinator with Cameron in Ravens under head coach John Harbaugh in 2008, didn't think teams could learn any pertinent information from the behind-the-scenes look the show provided. \"What you going to learn?\" Rex Ryan asked reporters on Saturday. \"You guys saw it. What did you get out of it?\" The series showed footage of the Jets' depth chart as it evolved throughout the preseason. NFL scouts told ESPNNewYork.com that they were stunned to see the information. Still, Rex Ryan said the Ravens could learn more from looking at their own playbook because he employs the same defensive game plan with the Jets that he did during his days in Ravens. \"There might be something in the playbook that might be a little more revealing than what you saw on'Hard Knocks,'\" Rex Ryan said. Jets corner Antonio Cromartie pointed out that Cameron didn't do much with the information provided by the previous'Hard Knocks,' which featured Ravens's division rival, the Bengals. Ravens lost both games to the Bengals in 2009. \"Good luck; that's all I could tell Cam,\" Antonio Cromartie said. \"Good luck with it.\" Defensive tackle Kris Jenkins had a different take. \"I know we sacrificed some things by being on'Hard Knocks' because they got to see some things about us. Some strengths. Some weaknesses,\" Jenkins said. \"But when it's all said and done, it's still football. \"I don't think [information revealed on'Hard Knocks'] is... going to be detrimental to our season or our goals.

The University of Michigan said Kramer died Saturday at his home. It did not release the cause of death. Kramer caught two TD passes from Bart Starr in Packers's 1961 NFL championship victory over the Giants. He had his most productive season in 1962 with 37 receptions for 555 yards and seven touchdowns and was an All-Pro. Kramer spent seven seasons with the Packers after being drafted in the first round with the fourth overall pick in 1957. He did not play in 1958, when he joined the Air Force while recovering from a leg injury suffered at the end of his rookie season. He finished his career with three seasons in Lions, the city where he grew up, retiring after the 1967 season. Lions President Tom Lewand said in a statement that Kramer was one of the city's most accomplished athletes. \"It was so fitting that Ron ended his prestigious career playing for his hometown team,\" Lewand said. \"He will be dearly missed.\" Kramer earned three letters each in football, basketball and track at Michigan and led the Wolverines in scoring for two seasons in football. His number 87 is one of just five numbers retired by the school in football. He played offensive and defensive end, running back, quarterback, kicker and receiver. \"He called me after every loss, and that meant a lot because it's a lonely feeling to lose when you're the coach at Michigan,\" former Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said Saturday night. \"I'll never forget that he used to bring our team apples because he remembered somebody doing that for him when he played at Michigan.\" As a basketball player, Kramer scored 1,119 points and was the team's Most Valuable Player as a junior. He set the school's all-time scoring record as team captain his senior year with 1,124 points, a standard that stood until 1961. Despite his 230-pound frame, he competed in the high jump in track. \"Ron was one of the great Michigan athletes of the 20th century,\" Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon said in a statement released by the university. After retiring, he operated Ron Kramer Industries in Fenton, Mich., about 35 miles north of Ann Arbor. Kramer was elected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. In 1981, he was named a recipient of the NCAA's Silver Anniversary Award in recognition of significant professional and civic contributions spanning 25 years after completion of his collegiate eligibility. He was born June 24, 1935, in Girard, Kan., and his family moved to the Lions area when he was 5.

Even after 49ers defensive star Patrick Willis received a hefty new deal in May. \"I didn't let it bother me,\" Vernon Davis said. \"I prayed about it. My grandmother prayed about it.\" That patience paid off. Now, Vernon Davis is the highest-paid tight end in NFL history. The 26-year-old Vernon Davis signed a five-year extension with 49ers on Saturday, a day before the team opens the season at NFC West rival Seahawks as the division favorite. He heard from his agent Friday night that things were a go. Vernon Davis is relieved to have this done before the season begins, thus avoiding entering free agency after 2010. \"It's a beautiful thing, especially going into the season not worrying about it,\" Vernon Davis said. \"It's not weighing heavy on my mind. Just go out on the field and continue to perform.\" Sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the deal is worth $37 million with $23 million guaranteed, making Vernon Davis the highest-paid tight end in NFL history. \"Being the highest paid tight end at my position says a lot but when it comes down to it I'm not playing the game for money. It's about passion,\" Vernon Davis said. \"I didn't let it get to me because the only thing I could focus on is football. One thing about me once the season starts, I'm 100 percent football and that's all.\" Vernon Davis, entering his fifth NFL season, led the 49ers last season with 78 catches for 965 yards and 13 touchdowns, which matched Gates' NFL record for TDs by a tight end. Vernon Davis made his first Pro Bowl in 2009 and tied for the league lead in touchdown catches with Randy Moss and Larry Fitzgerald. \"I found myself saying this earlier this spring I couldn't be happier for an individual to sign a contract extension and be with the 49ers for five more years, and that was Patrick Willis,\" coach Mike Singletary said in a conference call Saturday night from Seahawks. \"Now that Vernon has signed, you're talking about two of the finest players at their positions in the league. I'm very happy for Vernon because he deserves everything he gets.\" Vernon Davis has 181 receptions for 2,097 yards and 22 touchdowns in his career. Selected sixth overall in 2006 out of Maryland, Vernon Davis started eight games as a rookie and has been a regular, when healthy, ever since. He also is a team captain, a good blocker as well as a threat over the middle and deep. Mike Singletary said he has no concerns about the money going to Vernon Davis' head. \"Vernon is a guy, if you find a guy who comes in and he's one of hardest working guys on your team if not the hardest working guy on your team, what's going to change him?\" Mike Singletary said. \"That's been the mark of Vernon Davis since he got here.\" In extending Vernon Davis' contract, the 49ers have made deals with two of their best players -- on either side of the ball. Vernon Davis joins Patrick Willis, the Niners' All-Pro linebacker. New vice president of player personnel Trent Baalke orchestrated the extensions in two significant moves since he took over football operations following the abrupt departure of general manager Scot McCloughan in March. Once known for scuffling with teammates, Vernon Davis has become a team leader under Mike Singletary. They have had their moments in the past, too. Mike Singletary sent Vernon Davis to the showers early during the coach's debut in October 2008 against Seahawks for the way he reacted to a personal foul penalty. Vernon Davis has come a long way since that day, taming down his once volatile antics and not letting opponents get to him on the field. He considers growing up a big part of his success -- and he largely credits Mike Singletary in that transformation. Mike Singletary knows Vernon Davis will come to play every game and every practice, and have fun in the process. \"All you have to do is look at the identity of the 49ers and Vernon fits it,\" Mike Singletary said. \"We're very fortunate to have him here. He's a great role model for the rest of our players.\" Vernon Davis and second-year wide receiver Michael Crabtree got into a verbal on-field spat during a training camp practice, after which Vernon Davis said he was simply displaying his leadership. Mike Singletary, who stepped between the players and took both to the locker room for a chat, also said he appreciated Vernon Davis' efforts though perhaps not his methods. Vernon Davis said afterward he was frustrated by some things Michael Crabtree did that he \"didn't like.\" \"It was a matter of being a team captain. All I was doing was taking care of my responsibilities and doing my job,\" Vernon Davis said.

If the Giants had a soundtrack to their summer, it would undoubtedly be to the tune of the enthusiastic defensive coordinator's voice, sometimes heard screaming at his players to get to the quarterback, pick up every loose ball on the ground and run it back to the end zone. And sometimes, Fewell's players had to listen to him actually sing. While some coaches, like Eric Mangini, like to play rap during practices, Fewell uses music and movies to drive home his teachings to his defense. This preseason, the North Panthers product has referenced the comedy \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" to tell his defenders to do just that. He's told his players to follow Anita Baker's mantra of \"Giving You The Best That I Got.\" He's also used Cameo's \"Candy\" and Guy's \"Teddy's Jam\" to aid his teachings. And he will sing the lyrics if need be. Picture an impromptu karaoke session breaking out in one of Tom Coughlin's practices. \"Jam! Ohhh, Jam! Teddy Jam for me!\" safeties coach Dave Merritt sang as he mimicked Fewell's best Guy impression earlier this summer. \"He said,'OK corners, that is what we have to do, we have to jam right?' All the guys bust out in a laugh. It keeps the room at an even keel but at the same time we are still about business.\" Fewell said Thursday that he hadn't decided what he will use in his message to the defense Saturday. \"I liked Anita Baker,\" outside linebacker Keith Bulluck said of Fewell's musical choices. \"He has a certain way he wants us to play. He will use the lyrics of a song to drill it home as a final teaching point as far as conveying a message to the guys so they can get it. He has his own unique style.\" No matter what song or movie he chooses to emphasize his point, it's a good bet that Fewell will harp on stopping Panthers's rushing attack. The Panthers' two-headed monster of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart is perhaps the best combo in the NFL. Both rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season. And the Giants know just how good the two are from first-hand experience. During a pivotal late December game against the Giants in 2008, DeAngelo Williams rushed for 108 yards and four touchdowns in a 34-28 loss to the Giants. Last year, with DeAngelo Williams hurt, Stewart flattened the Giants for 206 yards and a touchdown as Panthers shut down Giants Stadium for good with a 41-9 thrashing in December. Perhaps Fewell will use something like Public Enemy's \"Shut'Em Down\" as his message to stop the Panthers. The Giants understand that if they are to go anywhere this season, they must do it with stifling defense. Fewell must restore a once proud defense that was decimated by injuries and undermined by confusion and poor relationships. Some players like Osi Umenyiora clashed with former defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan and communication was a weak spot on defense on Sundays as well. The Giants surrendered an average of 26.7 points per game, including 40 or more points in three of their final four games. After starting off 5-0 only to finish 8-8 with embarrassing defensive efforts such as the Panthers humiliation, the Giants rebuilt their defense by signing safety Antrel Rolle and using five of seven draft picks on defensive players. And the most important addition was Fewell, who came from Bills, where he was the defensive coordinator and interim head coach. Fewell may be old school with his teachings and his music. But he employs some new school schemes to utilize all of the Giants' strengths. \"I have a plan of attack that I want to try and dictate what they will see,\" Fewell said of the Panthers. \"So I'm not going to be defensive. I'm going to be offensive, and I'm going to try and dictate what they will see.\" During training camp, Fewell unveiled packages like the \"Big Base\" defense that had defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka playing outside linebacker and defensive tackle Chris Canty playing defensive end. And then there was the ever-popular \"NASCAR\" alignment that features the defense's strength with four defensive ends on the field. Fewell promises he has plenty more tricks in store for the Panthers. \"You probably saw 10 percent, maybe 20 percent in the preseason, maybe, if that,\" Fewell said. \"How confident am I that our guys will have our package down? I'm very confident. They had good retention. They had good questions when we went in and presented on Monday as well as Wednesday. So I feel very confident they will have the information down that we need.\" And if not, Fewell will choose the perfect song to get his point across. Perhaps he should go with James Brown's \"The Payback.\" There's no better way for Fewell's defense to open the season and a new stadium than with some big payback against the Panthers.

And some may seek to reprise the salute Sunday and Monday. \"That's just a great way to show respect from one player to another,\" said safety George Wilson, the union rep for the Bills, from the team's practice facility in Orchard Park, N.Y. Minutes before the NFL's season opener Thursday night, the Saints and Vikings emerged from the sideline, walking onto the field with their right index fingers raised before pausing about 10 yards out. The players raised one finger to show they are one unit as the bargaining process goes forward. The NFL is facing a possible lockout for the 2011 season if the owners and players can't reach a compromise on a new collective bargaining agreement. The NFL has declined to comment on Thursday night's gesture and the possibility of others during Sunday and Monday's games. At his retirement news conference Friday in Nashville, NFLPA president Kevin Mawae said he was at the Vikings-Saints game and liked the show of unity. \"It was a great step by the leaders on both of those teams,\" he said. \"...We're not calling players saying'Everybody needs to do this.' That move was leadership, driven by the players not the organization.\" One of the Cowboys' player representatives, Jason Witten, said he didn't see Thursday night's gesture but was briefed on it soon afterward. \"I thinks it's special,\" Jason Witten said after practice Friday. \"Guys on our team are talking about it and it's especially neat to see Drew Brees and Steve Hutchinson, some of the best players in the league, showing that. It's very unselfish on their part.\" The Cowboys open their season with a primetime Sunday night matchup at Redskins against the Redskins. Asked if they would do something similar, Cowboys center Andre Gurode said he thought Cowboys' player reps might hold a team meeting to discuss their ideas. \"We're all in this together,\" Andre Gurode said. \"Past, present and future players.\" But not every player was steadfast with support. Cowboys receiver Roy Williams said he \"stays out of politics\" and added he doesn't vote in presidential elections. Asked to elaborate on his ambivalence toward the looming labor battle, Roy Williams declined. Around the Giants locker room on Friday players backed the gesture, though the prospect of a similar action for Sunday's game against the visiting Panthers hadn't been brought up. Giants defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said if fans could see the players' positions they might be able to have an actual influence on the process. \"They probably have a bigger voice than they understand that they do,\" Mathias Kiwanuka said. \"So if the fans are against the lockout and come out and support the players and our side, they can probably do a lot more than they think they can as far as avoiding that situation.\" Giants defensive end Osi Umenyiora said the country's economic problems may make it hard for fans to choose sides when billions of dollars are involved. \"It's important for everybody to know what's going on what the issues are,\" Osi Umenyiora said. \"Because from the outside looking in it could probably seem like two groups of people who are making a bunch of money who are squabbling over semantics. So I think it's important for people to know that nobody wants to get the short end of the stick here. Because I see where the owners are coming and I see where the players are coming from also.\" But Osi Umenyiora said the labor situation went beyond the money and reached to the personal lives of players. \"We don't want to alienate the fans. We don't want to make them think that we're just a bunch of greedy people walking around. But at the end of the day we still must do what we have to do,\" Osi Umenyiora said. Bills safety George Wilson said Thursday night's gesture \"gladiator-like, almost.\" \"When I saw it, it sent chills down my body,\" George Wilson said. \"It was a true acknowledgment from one team to an opponent:'Yeah, we're about to embark on 60 minutes of hell, of physical competition, aggression and passion, but before we do that, we're one team, one locker room.' \" George Wilson said the impact reached its intended target. \"I guarantee without a shadow of a doubt, every owner had a conversation about what they saw and what it means moving forward,\" George Wilson said. \"Our players are together. Even though we're playing football, we're businessmen and family men. Even though we're about to go into he heat of battle, we're conscious of everything that's going on around our game right now and the lockout that's looming.\" Dolphins backup quarterback Chad Pennington said teams should decide for themselves whether they want to duplicate the display. \"I think it should go team by team,\" Pennington said. \"If they think it's necessary and they feel they want to do it, then why not? Shoot, unfortunately, it's the position we're in. It's a gesture of unity and believing in the same thing and standing for a common goal. I don't really see a problem with it.\" Information from ESPN.com's Tim Graham, Matt Mosley, Paul Kuharsky and ESPNNewYork.com's Jane McManus was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5555941", "Entities": ["Saints", "Vikings", "George Wilson", "Bills", "Cowboys", "Jason Witten", "Drew Brees", "Steve Hutchinson", "Redskins", "Andre Gurode", "Roy Williams", "Giants", "Panthers", "Mathias Kiwanuka", "Osi Umenyiora", "Dolphins"]}, {"title": "Source: Albert Haynesworth will play", "author": "Ed Werder", "date": "Sep 12, 2010", "content": "Despite their contentious relationship, Redskins coach Mike Shanahan has decided defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth will play in the season opener against the Cowboys on Sunday night, a team source said Saturday.

So did the Dave Matthews Band. And Taylor Swift. And Brad Pitt. And the NFL commish. And seemingly every TV satellite truck in the Western Hemisphere. For one Thursday day and night, Saints was the Who's Who capital for Who Dat. You couldn't swing a fleur-de-lis in this town without hitting someone who was still on a Super Bowl high. And if they weren't celebrating last season, they were celebrating the start of this season. \"Unbelievable,\" said new Saints defensive end Alex Brown. \"Absolutely amazing.... When we first came out I thought I was going to have to put my hands over my ears because my head was ringing. Oh, man.\" The Superdome crowd of 70,051 (seemed like 170,051) was so deafening that jet engines asked Saints fans to keep it down. And just to be on the safe side, structural engineers should check the stadium roof for cracks. So, yes, the Saints left here with possible hearing loss and a 14-9 victory against the Vikings, the same team Saints beat in the NFC Championship eight months ago. That game felt epic. This one felt like the fifth game of the preseason. \"Ugly\" is how Saints running back Reggie Bush described it. And he was right. Ugly and beautiful at the same time, because 1-0 looks a lot more attractive than the Vikings' 0-1. But cut away the ankle tape of this game and the Saints are left staring at a new reality: A Two Dat -- Saints shorthand for back-to-back Lombardi trophies -- is going to be harder than the Saints ever imagined. I'm not saying the Saints are suffering from a Super Bowl hangover, but their fans are. Bourbon Street still has bruise marks from the post-championship celebration. They figure the Saints will keep doing what they did last season, which was force a million turnovers and lead the world in points scored. But Thursday evening's game revealed once again why only two teams (the Patriots and Broncos) have won consecutive Super Bowls in the past 16 seasons. You have to have abs of steel to take everyone's best punch. And you have to be able to hit back. \"You want to beat the best because you kind of want to measure yourself as a team to see where you're at,\" Reggie Bush said. \"We've been in that position before and now it's the other teams' turn to chase us. I love it that way. I wouldn't have it any other way. We want everybody's A game. We don't want to sneak up on anybody anymore. People are aware of us. They know they got to bring their A game when they play us.\" The Vikings brought their B-minus game. Brett Favre played his age or, at least, played rusty. For every gorgeous pass (like the precision missile strike to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe down the seam for a 33-yard gain late in the second quarter), there were two underthrown passes. At times you wondered if Brett Favre could complete a pass to one of the Wrangler jeans guys. Vikings was without injured star wide receiver Sidney Rice. They were down to three healthy cornerbacks. They were playing in the Ear Plug Dome. And yet, the Saints won by only five points. Their defense played well, but the Drew Brees -led offense was noticeably off. Only 308 net yards? Three-of-11 on third downs? Dropped passes? Two missed field goals? \"We're not used to 14-9 victories, but we're used to winning,\" Drew Brees said. That's what matters. But the Saints know their margin of error is as wide as a smudge of eye black. They're no longer the adorable little Drew Brees-ettes. They've got the trophy, the rings and now the pursuers. \"We've forgotten about last year a long time ago,\" Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma said. \"I know the fans have been partying and enjoying it, but we've moved on a long time ago.... Last season was last season. Last season was special, and we enjoyed it. But this is a new season, and we've got to prove ourselves all over again.\" Jonathan Vilma did his part. He cuddled one of Brett Favre's forced floaters for an interception, but the Saints' offense could only budge the ball forward 2 yards. Then the usually reliable Garrett Hartley came in and missed a 46-yarder. He later missed a 32-yard chippy. \"Things like that are inexcusable at this level,\" Garrett Hartley said. The Saints' D made Adrian Peterson earn every one of his 87 rushing yards. And on more than a few occasions Brett Favre had to hurry throws because of pressure. He completed 15 of 27 passes for 171 yards and easily could have had more than the one interception. A season ago those Saints wouldn't have let the Vikings hang around. Drew Brees would have exploited the Vikings' napkin-thin secondary for huge yardage and points. This time they picked their spots and then closed out the game with running back Pierre Thomas. Interesting. \"We answered a lot of questions tonight,\" Saints cornerback Tracy Porter said. Actually, no they didn't. The question that matters remains the same: Can the Saints win a second consecutive Super Bowl? Right now, the answer is, absolutely maybe.

But at the last moment, just when both sides thought there would be a deal, talks collapsed over an apology, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. About two weeks ago, Logan Mankins and his agent Frank Bauer arrived at the Patriots training facility in Foxborough, Mass., with both sides intending and believing they would be able to hammer out a long-term deal similar to the seven-year, $56.7 million contract that Pro Bowl guard Jahri Evans signed with Saints in the spring. Shortly before the deal could be consummated, the Patriots asked Logan Mankins to apologize to Patriots owner Robert Kraft for comments he made in June, questioning the Patriots owner's integrity. Logan Mankins did. He called Kraft, apologized and explained why he spoke out in the way he did. It was a nice conversation and it paved the way for Logan Mankins' long-term deal to be consummated. Then, about 90 minutes later, just before finalizing the deal, the Patriots requested Logan Mankins issue a public apology. Not only did Logan Mankins refuse, but he became offended, according to sources. The optimism that had been built, the momentum that the talks had generated, completed collapsed -- and even regressed. Now Logan Mankins no longer wants to play in Patriots, and the Patriots may be forced to trade him with no resolution in sight. In an appearance on a radio pregame show, Patriots president Jonathan Kraft acknowledged that Logan Mankins called owner Robert Kraft to apologize privately for his previous remarks on Kraft, but did not elaborate on the details of this report, saying he had not read it. Kraft did say that the Patriots offered Logan Mankins a contract that \"compared to the other top guard contracts stacks up favorably.\" The sides have a difference of opinion, however. Kraft said the team would still be open to having Logan Mankins return on his restricted free-agent tender offer. Logan Mankins has refused to sign his $3.26 million tender offer from the Patriots. \"We'd love to have him back,\" he said. \"He's a great football player.\" Logan Mankins, a two-time Pro Bowler, would have been an unrestricted free agent under the rules of the last collective bargaining agreement. However, when the owners opted out of the deal, triggering 2010's uncapped year, only players with six years in the NFL gained unrestricted status. A trade will not be easy. Any interested team would have to satisfy the Patriots' and Logan Mankins' wishes for compensation. One might be easy; two would be extremely difficult. Adam Schefter is ESPN's NFL Insider.

The unheralded Foster rushed for a team-record 231 yards and scored three second-half touchdowns to help power Texans to a 34-24 victory over Colts. Foster, a second-year player who spent most of last season on the Texans' practice squad, had a 1-yard TD run in the third quarter and fourth-quarter scores of 25 and 8 yards. He had the NFL's second-best opening weekend performance since 1933, topped only by O.J. Simpson's 250 in 1973 for the Bills against Patriots. Johnson Running back, Titans Johnson picked up right where he left off last season, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs in Titans's 38-13 romp of Raiders. Johnson, the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year in 2009, extended his streak to 12 consecutive 100-yard games to break a tie with Marcus Allen. He trails only Barry Sanders, who had an NFL-best streak of 14 such games. Nicks Wide receiver, Giants Nicks began his sophomore season with a bang. The 2009 first-round pick caught three TD passes from Eli Manning, all in the left corner of the end zone, as the Giants opened their new stadium with a 31-18 victory over Panthers. Nicks' 5-yard TD grab in the third quarter gave New York some breathing room with an eight-point lead. Nicks also had scoring catches of 26 and 19 yards. Forte Running back, Bears Forte is the Bears' best running back. In Week 1 he was their go-to receiver as well. Forte caught seven passes, including two TDs, for 151 yards to help Bears edge the Lions, 19-14. Forte's 28-yard TD reception gave the Bears the lead for good with 1:32 left. Forte also had 50 rushing yards on 17 carries. Brady Quarterback, Patriots Brady ended an eventful week (car accident, new contract) by lighting up the Bengals' vaunted defense. The veteran quarterback threw for 258 yards with three TDs and no interceptions, guiding Patriots to a 38-24 victory. Two of Brady's TD tosses went to Wes Welker, who returned to action less than eight months after a serious knee surgery. Led by prized free-agent addition Karlos Dansby, the Dolphins turned in a dominant defensive effort in a 15-10 victory over Bills. Karlos Dansby had a sack and eight tackles as Dolphins held the Bills to 166 total yards. Spiller Running back, Bills Spiller was drafted to spark the Bills' offense, but it didn't happen in Week 1. The rookie first-round pick gained only 7 yards on six carries in Bills's loss to the Dolphins. The Bills had only 50 rushing yards overall. Campbell Quarterback, Raiders Campbell's regular-season debut as the Raiders' starting quarterback was mostly forgettable. Campbell threw one interception, fumbled twice (losing one) and was sacked four times in Raiders's loss at Titans. Campbell finished with 180 passing yards and a 69.7 QB rating. Delhomme Quarterback, Browns His numbers weren't terrible (20-of-37, 227 yards), but one terrible throw changed the complexion of the Browns-Buccaneers matchup. With the Browns leading 14-3 late in the second quarter, Delhomme threw an ill-advised, sidearm pass that Ronde Barber intercepted and returned 65 yards to Browns' 3-yard line. Bucs QB Josh Freeman threw a TD pass on the next play, and the Browns weren't the same after that, ultimately losing 17-14. 49ers QB Alex Smith is at his best when he's supported by a strong running game. Well, he certainly didn't get that in Week 1. The 49ers rushed for only 49 yards on 19 carries (2.6 average) in their 31-6 loss at Seahawks.

At Texans, Jaguars, Tampa, Rams, Seahawks and Orchard Park, N.Y., players held up their index fingers before kickoff, replicating the gestures made by the Saints and Vikings before Thursday night's season opener in Saints. No such gestures were done at the New Meadowlands Stadium, nor in Foxborough, Mass., Bears, Steelers, Nashville or Eagles. The demonstrations are designed to show the support players have for each other in the final year of the CBA, from which the owners opted out in 2008. At Texans, about a dozen Colts, led by Peyton Manning, and nearly all of the Texans held up their index fingers just after the national anthem. Fans briefly booed the gesture. \"It's something that we feel is important, not just to show solidarity as players, or just,'We're going to fight the man, or whatever,'\" Texans tackle Eric Winston said. \"It's a show of solidarity saying that,'Hey, we're in it together with all the workers in the stadium, all the police officers that are working extra in here, all the firefighters, all the medical staff, all the businesses around the stadium.' \"That's what it's really all about. It's about the $140 million that every city loses if we don't have football next year. That's really what it's about. It's not just about us. We want football, because they deserve it, too.\" In Orchard Park, home of the Bills, numerous fans took note and some also raised their fingers. Most Bills players stepped off the sideline and onto the field with their index fingers raised toward the Dolphins. About three-quarters of the Dolphins then did the same. \"After watching the Saints and Vikings do it, it kind of sent chills down my body,\" said Bills safety George Wilson, their player representative to the union. George Wilson asked his teammates about making a similar demonstration and then talked to Dolphins's player rep, Ricky Williams. Both sides agreed to doing the gesture before Sunday's game. \"That shows you that at the end of the day we are men of the same fraternity,\" George Wilson added. \"We are all businessmen and family men, out here playing for our livelihood and playing for our families. For us to be on the same page before the kickoff was, more of anything, bringing awareness to the potential lockout that's looming for the 2011 season.\" In Jaguars, several Jaguars and Broncos walked toward middle of field near the hash marks with one finger raised after the national anthem. And in Tampa, players from both the Buccaneers and Browns came off sideline and held up one finger before the coin toss. Each player on the Rams and Cardinals stepped out on the field and held up fingers, and so did the team captains on their way to the coin toss at midfield. They didn't draw much crowd reaction. Seahawks and 49ers players all raised one finger at the conclusion of the national anthem. But nothing was done at the Panthers-Giants game. \"I didn't even know about it when the Saints played,\" Giants center Shaun O'Hara said. \"It wasn't like they told everybody they were going to do that. I thought they handled it well, but we didn't talk about doing anything here because it doesn't get anything done. Players right now, our responsibility is our jobs and focusing on games. We have people to negotiate for us. We are not negotiating ourselves so it's not anything we are concerned about now.\" Jets fullback Tony Richardson, a longtime key union figure who coincidentally was released by the Jets in the final preseason cut, then re-signed, likes what he has seen. \"Well, I think, that obviously was a great start,\" said Tony Richardson, whose team plays Monday night against Ravens. \"Our offensive line has been talking about one team, one voice, one heartbeat. That's not going to change. We all stand together. Just like the owners, they all stand together. \"The biggest thing is we want to get some work done, so it's not like us versus them. It's the fact that we have a great working relationship and we want to continue that working relationship.

Kevin Boss was taken off the field on a cart after he was hit in the back of the head by Panthers safety Sherrod Martin in the first quarter and did not return to the game. The NFL instituted a stricter concussion policy in December 2009 that stated players who show signs or symptoms of a concussion cannot return to the field on the same day. Kevin Boss was hit in the back of the head by Sherrod Martin's helmet as he came down after trying to corral an Eli Manning pass on second-and-23 from the Giants' 31-yard line at 11:19 of the first quarter. Kevin Boss got onto the cart on his own and was sitting up as he was carted off the field. He spent the second half of the Giants' 31-18 win over the Panthers on the sideline. Backup tight end Travis Beckum replaced Kevin Boss on Sunday. He and Kevin Boss are the only tight ends on the Giants' 53-man roster. Tackle William Beatty was forced to line up at tight end on a few plays. Beckum said he spoke with Kevin Boss in the locker room at halftime and on the sideline in the second half. He indicated that Kevin Boss was unaffected by the collision. \"He's doing fine. It's just a little hit to the back of the head. He was perfect,\" Beckum said. Giants coach Tom Coughlin did not have an update on Kevin Boss' condition after the game. Kevin Boss is no stranger to helmet-to-helmet collisions. He took a helmet-to-helmet hit from then-Cardinals safety Antrel Rolle last season and another from Chargers safety Eric Weddle. The hits occurred in back-to-back weeks but Kevin Boss and team doctors said at the time that he did not have a concussion. Kevin Boss' status for the Giants' Week 2 game in Colts is unclear. Beatty, who lined up as an eligible receiver on several plays against the Panthers, injured his right foot in the fourth quarter and was in a walking cast after the game. The results of X-rays taken on his foot weren't immediately available. Tom Coughlin said the Giants had prepared for life without Kevin Boss by working on offensive sets with Beckum and Beatty at tight end. In all likelihood, the Giants will be looking to add a tight end if they lose Kevin Boss for an extended period. \"We were forced to use those combinations much earlier than we would have hoped,\" the Giants coach said. \"We also came out of some things that we just weren't able to do so we had to scramble a little bit to get back and narrow in on what we could and couldn't do but we made a nice adjustment there. The offensive coaches did a real nice job of adjusting and I think we were able to go forward.\" Beckum, who finished with two catches for 11 yards against the Panthers, said he was comfortable taking over as the starting tight end if necessary. \"Once one guy goes down, somebody has to step up in his place. Him going down, I mean [it's unfortunate] but somebody's got to do it and that's what I did,\" Beckum said.

They may have been a little threatening then. They certainly don't bother him now. David Garrard threw three touchdown passes, finished with his best passer rating and helped Jaguars beat the Broncos 24-17 on Sunday in a season opener the Jaguars called one of the most important in franchise history. \"This was big for us,\" said tight end Marcedes Lewis, who caught two TD passes. \"We really got some juice out of our squeeze.\" As for Tim Tebow? Well, the former Florida star made his NFL debut in his hometown and got rousing support. But he was a non-factor in the game. The Broncos can't say the same about David Garrard, who completed 16 of 21 passes for 170 yards. His QB rating was 138.9, besting his previous high set in 2006. \"Everybody in this room believes in Dave and understands he's our leader,\" Marcedes Lewis said. \"This is big for him. It's big for his confidence. If Dave is going to be great, then everyone else has to be great around him.\" David Garrard got plenty of help. Mike Thomas caught six passes for 89 yards. Maurice Jones-Drew ran for 98 yards. Adam Podlesh dropped two punts inside the 10-yard line. Tiquan Underwood returned a kickoff 53 yards that set up a field goal. Maybe the most telling stat: Jaguars, which ranked last in the league with 14 sacks last season, had three in the opener and hit Kyle Orton several other times. \"You get what you emphasize, usually,\" said Aaron Kampman, the team's biggest offseason acquisition who was involved in two sacks. \"We have emphasized getting after the passer.\" Aaron Kampman kept the outing in perspective, pointing out that Broncos played with two rookies (center J.D. Walton and right tackle Zane Beadles) on the offensive line and had All-Pro left tackle Ryan Clady starting five months after knee surgery. \"They had some guys who didn't have a ton of experience in the league,\" Aaron Kampman said. \"But they're still NFL players out there.\" The Jaguars, coming off a 7-9 season in which they blacked out nine of 10 home games, needed to get off to a good start to keep fans in the seats and eliminate more talk about relocation. Tim Tebow's debut made a victory even more imperative, especially since some Jaguars fans clamored for the former University of Florida star. The Broncos wasted little time getting Tim Tebow on the field. The college football icon who grew up in Jaguars entered on the third play. He gained a yard on a quarterback keeper. He returned two plays later and lined up at receiver. Tim Tebow picked up another yard on his second carry, this one coming in the second quarter. \"It was a learning opportunity for me, an opportunity to get better,\" Tim Tebow said. Tim Tebow spent the rest of the game on the sideline. Kyle Orton was much more effective -- at least until the fourth quarter. Kyle Orton was 21 of 33 for 295 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. Kyle Orton's fourth-down pass to Brandon Lloyd in the corner of the end zone was ruled incomplete with 4:41 remaining. Brandon Lloyd, who caught four passes for 106 yards, didn't get two feet down. \"Made a lot of plays, but left a few out there,\" Kyle Orton said. \"We didn't make enough plays and that's unfortunate.\" The Broncos got the ball back with 1:50 left, but Daryl Smith stepped in front of Eddie Royal and picked off Kyle Orton's pass near midfield. Kyle Orton blamed some of the problems on static he was getting in his helmet, possibly the result of a thunderstorm that moved through Jaguars and forced a 33-minute delay between the third and fourth quarters. \"Anytime you're on the road in the NFL, you have to be prepared for that,\" he said. \"We put ourselves in the situation to win, but didn't make the plays down the stretch.\" Broncos might not have been behind had it not been for defensive end Ryan McBean's two costly penalties. McBean was flagged twice for grabbing Maurice Jones-Drew's face mask on the winning drive. The Jaguars used the extra 30 yards to move 83 yards in seven plays, capping the drive with David Garrard's 24-yard strike to Kassim Osgood. It was Osgood's first TD catch since 2004 -- maybe the reason he celebrated so wildly. Osgood was flagged for celebrating, a penalty that gave the Broncos good field position. Kyle Orton got them down to the Jaguars 14, but his third-and-3 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and his fourth-down throw was a bit wide. David Garrard didn't make the same mistakes. \"Those are the types of plays that we got to make all year,\" he said. Game notes Jaguars CB Derek Cox was benched in the third quarter after getting beat several times. \"Tough game for me,\" he said. \"Some days you're on, and today I wasn't on like I want to be.\"...

Opening with a sack three plays into a 15-10 season-opening win over Bills on Sunday, the linebacker finished his debut with a team-leading eight tackles in helping limit Bills to a mere 166 yards. \"I'm not surprised,\" said Karlos Dansby, the former Cardinals star who became the Dolphins' top offseason free-agent addition after signing a five-year $43 million contract. \"We expected to come here and win like this. It didn't have to be pretty.\" Lack of style points aside, the defense -- under new coordinator Mike Nolan and starting two rookies -- was stout and effective in a game Dolphins never trailed. Except for allowing the Bills' hurry-up attack to cut the lead to 13-10 on Roscoe Parrish's 31-yard touchdown catch with 5:13 left, the Dolphins kept Bills thoroughly at bay. The Bills had had nine first downs, endured six three-and-outs, and managed just 72 yards offense and five first downs on their first nine possessions. Ronnie Brown scored on a 1-yard plunge and Dan Carpenter made field goals of 43 and 32 yards as Dolphins snapped a five-game skid at Bills (not including a 16-3 win in 2008 at Toronto) and opened the season with a win for the first time since 2005. And starting fast was the message instilled by coach Tony Sparano, who had a clock erected in the Dolphins' locker room counting down the hours, minutes and seconds in leading up to Sunday's game as a reminder of how important it was for his team to be focused after opening last season 0-3. \"The clock started like 120 days ago, and finally getting in here and accomplishing that mission, I think that's the best feeling,\" said linebacker Cameron Wake, who added a sack and three tackles. The clock meanwhile remains stuck on Groundhog Day for the Bills, whose offense had a familiar popgun appearance to it in Chan Gailey's debut as coach. \"Frustrating is a good word to use,\" quarterback Trent Edwards said. \"We just shot ourselves in the foot.\" Penalties, missed blocking assignments, the lack of a running attack and a limited deep-threat attack all hurt an offense that was booed off the field two possessions in when Edwards checked down to hit Lee Evans over the middle for a 2-yard gain on third-and-12. Things didn't get any better in the second half when, trailing 10-3, the Bills squandered numerous chances to get back in the game. The first two drives -- both starting in Dolphins territory -- ended with three-and-outs. Then the Bills went backward on their third series, courtesy of two holding penalties. \"If fingers need to be pointed, they need to be pointed back at me,\" Chan Gailey said. \"We didn't play well enough to win, and that's my responsibility.\" The only time the Bills showed any rhythm came when they switched to the hurry-up mode with 9:32 left in the fourth quarter. Edwards marched the Bills 85 yards on 10 plays, capping the drive by hitting Parrish for the touchdown on fourth-and-11. It proved too little too late. Backed up to their own 1 on their next possession, the Bills gave up a safety in a bid to get better field position. The gamble didn't work. They got the ball back at their own 20 with 36 seconds left, but the game ended after Edwards' 9-yard completion to David Nelson. The Bills showed none of the offensive spark they displayed through the preseason. Edwards finished 18 of 34 for 139 yards, and was nearly intercepted three times. Rookie first-round pick C.J. Spiller had 6 yards on seven carries after scoring three TDs in the preseason. Dolphins receiver Brandon Marshall had an effective debut since being acquired in an offseason trade with Broncos. He finished with team-leading eight catches for 53 yards. Chad Henne went 21 for 34 for 182 yards passing. Brandon Marshall directed the credit to Dolphins's defense. \"Our defense holding them to 166 total yards is amazing,\" Brandon Marshall said. \"We feed off each other.\" The Dolphins spent the offseason retooling an aging unit that finished 22nd in the league last year, when it allowed 379 yards per game -- Dolphins's worst season since 1989. Rookie second-round pick, linebacker Koa Misi finished with a sack and four tackles. \"It feels great to be 1-0. It's a good first step,\" Tony Sparano said. \"It validates some of the things we've been talked about. The guys in that locker room believed in it.\" Game notes Bills LB Paul Posluszny did not return after hurting his right knee on the first play of the second half.

Not with the Steelers returning to their decades-long cornerstones for winning, defense and the running game. Rashard Mendenhall ran 50 yards for a touchdown 2:35 into overtime and the Steelers overcame a shaky start by replacement quarterback Dennis Dixon and a missed field goal attempt late in regulation to beat the Falcons 15-9 on Sunday. \"We've got to prepare for those type of games [without Ben Roethlisberger],\" defensive end Brett Keisel said. \"We'll take a win any way we can get it, anyhow we can get it.\" Rashard Mendenhall carried 22 times for 120 yards. A Steelers defense that was the NFL's best two seasons ago before slipping a year ago held Falcons (0-1) to 58 yards rushing -- former All-Pro Michael Turner gained 42 yards -- and three Matt Bryant field goals. \"In the run game, you've got to be patient,\" said Rashard Mendenhall, who cut to his right, found the open field and took it in despite stumbling near the 10 on his game-winner. \"You wait all day for something like that to open up. The run game, you've got to stick with it and stick with it.\" Steelers (1-0) appeared ready to win it with 39 seconds left in the fourth quarter, but Jeff Reed, who has nine career game-winning kicks, was wide right on a 40-yard attempt. Jeff Reed had hit earlier from 52, 36 and 34 yards. Jeff Reed's 34-yarder in the fourth made it 9-6, following catches of 25 and 24 yards on successive pass plays by Hines Ward. Hines Ward had 108 yards in his club record 26th career 100-yard game and went over 11,000 yards receiving in his career. Falcons tied it with 3:24 remaining on Matt Bryant's third field goal, a 23-yarder, after deciding against going for it on fourth and a long 1 at the Steelers 5. \"I felt we needed to tie the game,\" Falcons coach Mike Smith said. \"It was relatively simple when you consider the percentages.\" Michael Turner, despite averaging barely 2 yards per carry, felt they needed to run it. \"When coach called it, I was getting ready, getting myself pumped up,\" Michael Turner said. \"If we would have got that I think we would have probably finished the game off. But coach changed his mind. We have to trust his decision.\" It was the third overtime game in as many Falcons-Steelers meetings. They played a 34-all tie in 2002 at Heinz Field, and Falcons won 41-38 at home in 2006. Predictably, the Steelers came out with a conservative game plan with Dixon making his second career start and Ben Roethlisberger serving the first game of his four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. What was surprising was the Falcons played similarly. Matt Ryan was 27 of 44 for an ineffectual 252 yards and was intercepted by Troy Polamalu with 1:45 remaining, giving Jeff Reed his failed opportunity to win it. Roddy White made 13 catches for 111 yards, but the Falcons were within touchdown range only once while being outgained 354-295. Falcons didn't score until the final play of the first half, when Matt Bryant made a 49-yarder to tie it at 3 after Jeff Reed missed from 55. \"I think it's inexcusable, but they're a good defense,\" tight end Tony Gonzalez said. Troy Polamalu, injured most of last season, made a perceptible difference in a Steelers defense that gave up leads in the fourth quarter five times last season as Steelers went 9-7. \"I think for the most part we shut them down,\" Brett Keisel said of a defense that has only three starters younger than 30. \"Teams are going to test us. We're old and washed up and teams are going to see if we can still play.\" And if Troy Polamalu's hair is valued at $1 million -- his shampoo sponsor recently insured it -- how much are his hands worth? \"I don't know what the quarterback was thinking, but when you see number 43 [Troy Polamalu], don't throw it his way,\" linebacker James Farrior said. \"He's the best player I've ever played with.\" Dixon finished 18 of 26 for 236 yards with an interception and had several other potential interceptions dropped. He wasn't good enough to win most games but, with the Steelers' defense back to its dominating ways, wasn't bad enough to lose this one. \"Overall, I got overexcited,\" Dixon said. \"I'm just happy to have someone like Hines Ward and the savvy vets to calm me down.\" Dixon's one long completion, a 52-yarder to second-year receiver Mike Wallace, led to Jeff Reed's 36-yard field goal and a 6-all tie. Mike Wallace is starting in place of former Super Bowl MVP Santonio Holmes, who was dealt to the Jets. Coach Mike Tomlin wouldn't commit to starting Dixon at Titans on Sunday, but it is highly unlikely he would make a change following a win. The Falcons, 2-12-1 against the Steelers, took a 6-3 lead early in the third on Matt Bryant's 39-yarder, which was set up by Tony Gonzalez's 20-yard reception -- the 1,000th of his career. He is the first NFL tight end to reach that mark and the seventh receiver overall. Two Steelers starters were injured, nose tackle Casey Hampton (hamstring) and left tackle Max Starks (left ankle).

It took the Giants more than a half to fully feel comfortable in their $1.6 billion stadium. Then they surged past the Panthers, getting a little revenge along the way, in a 31-18 season-opening victory Sunday. \"It was a whole new half, and all the errors we made were out the window,\" said Hakeem Nicks, who caught three touchdown passes from Eli Manning, all in the left corner of the end zone. \"We just wanted to go out there and click.\" Did they ever. Ahmad Bradshaw set up his own 4-yard TD run in the fourth quarter with a 39-yard romp as New York outscored Panthers 17-2 in the second half. The Giants outgained the Panthers 196-72 in the last two periods of a generally sloppy game marred by nine turnovers -- five by Panthers -- and 16 penalties. \"We'll learn from what we did wrong and capitalize on it next week,\" Hakeem Nicks said. Actually, they learned quickly enough to take advantage right away against a team that routed them 41-9 in the hosts' final game at Giants Stadium last December. In 2005, the Panthers shut out the Giants in a playoff game at the same venue. But Panthers couldn't match New York in the second half this time before 77,245 fans -- considered a sellout despite the unusual sight of hundreds of empty seats in the $1.6 billion New Meadowlands Stadium. The Giants could not sell all the club seats, which don't count under league blackout rules. \"It was a good win,\" guard Rich Seubert said. \"Everybody knew what happened against them last season. It's always good when you open a new place, the new Giants Stadium, and get a win in it. It is going to be remembered for a long time.\" Hakeem Nicks finished with four catches for 75 yards, while Eli Manning went 20 for 30 for 263 yards. But he also was picked off three times. So was Panthers quarterback Matt Moore, who left the game wobbly in the final minutes after being sacked by Osi Umenyiora. \"Like all openers, everybody struggles to some degree,\" said Panthers coach John Fox, who in the final year of his contract doesn't need such collapses by his team. \"The first half, we did some decent things in the pass game. As they game wore on, it got more in their advantage. There's no question they made more plays than we did. We made a few more mistakes than they did.\" The opener hardly was a classic, often matching the gloomy weather and gray colors that dominate the stadium that already has hosted concerts, international soccer matches and preseason football. New York turned a botched snap on a Panthers punt into seven points as Hakeem Nicks caught his third TD pass late in the third quarter for a 24-16 lead. The second-year receiver already has half as many touchdowns as he scored as a rookie. The Giants had taken the lead for good on Lawrence Tynes' 31-yard field goal earlier in the period, a series kept alive by Eli Manning's quarterback sneak to gain the necessary few inches on fourth down. Although 30 points were scored in the opening half, neither offense was particularly sharp. Each side made some big plays through the air, but so did the defenses, with Panthers's Charles Godfrey and New York's Deon Grant each making interceptions. John Kasay had field goals of 21, 52 and 43 yards. New York offset that thanks mostly to the Eli Manning to Hakeem Nicks connection, which produced touchdowns of 26 and 19 yards. Hakeem Nicks' second TD capped an 80-yard drive that took just over a minute, but Mike Goodson's 45-yard kickoff runback followed. That gave Matt Moore 33 seconds, enough time to boost the Panthers ahead 16-14 with a pinpoint 19-yard pass to Steve Smith between three defenders. It was the first touchdown for the Panthers, who never got into the end zone in the preseason. Yet that was about the last gasp for Panthers, the league's youngest team. The inexperience showed in the last period, particularly when Matt Moore was picked off by Terrell Thomas and Kenny Phillips, both in the end zone. For New York, the second-half stinginess was a welcome change from the final two games of 2009, when the Giants yielded 80 points. Game notes The Giants, who opened last season 5-0 before slumping to 8-8, lost tight end Kevin Boss (neck/concussion) and special teams captain Chase Blackburn (knee). In addition to Matt Moore, Panthers WR Charly Martin sustained a concussion. Placekicker Todd Carter suffered back spasms...

The quarterback who makes headlines on and off the field threw two of his three touchdown passes to Wes Welker, who returned after a speedy recovery from a serious knee injury, and led the Patriots to a 38-24 opening win over the Bengals on Sunday. \"I'm glad it's over,\" Tom Brady said, \"but it was a good week.\" It was pretty special for Wes Welker, too. He caught eight passes for 64 yards less than nine months after tearing a knee ligament in the final game last season and less than eight months after surgery. Many doubted he'd be back for the opener, but he and Tom Brady were confident. \"I had pretty much instilled it in my mind that I would be back,\" Wes Welker said. \"I still have a ways to go.... I have this stupid knee brace I hate. I can't wait to burn it. We're getting there, slowly but surely.\" He had the most impact of any receiver, surpassing the Bengals' new much-hyped tandem of Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens, who combined for 19 receptions for 212 yards and a touchdown. Tom Brady and Wes Welker worked out together on the West Coast in the offseason. \"I spent a lot of time with him,\" Tom Brady said. \"I knew in February or March that he was going to be back on the field on opening day.\" For a time after Thursday's accident, there was some concern among fans whether Tom Brady would be there. But he quickly called the Patriots after the accident near his home in Boston to say he was OK and would be late for meetings. \"It's a scary thing,\" Tom Brady said. \"Fortunately, I was OK. Hopefully, the people in the other car are recovering quickly.\" Later that day, he agreed to a four-year extension worth $72 million. The annual average of $18 million is the highest of any NFL player. \"I'm more excited about the win,\" Tom Brady said. \"Contracts take care of themselves.\" On Sunday, the Patriots' dominance was complete as they also scored on defense with Gary Guyton's 59-yard interception return and on special teams on Brandon Tate's 97-yard runback of the second-half kickoff. \"Obviously, you allow a kickoff return for a touchdown and an interception return for a touchdown, that's hard to overcome,\" Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said. \"It's hard to see through the muck, but there were some positives.\" Not many for his defense, though. \"We weren't ourselves today,\" Bengals cornerback Leon Hall said. \"Today was really unacceptable.\" Wes Welker led the NFL with 346 receptions the past three years, the last coming on Jan. 3 in the regular-season finale at Texans. He hurt his knee on the play and missed Patriots's 33-14 first-round playoff loss to Ravens. The Ravens led that game 24-0 in Gillette Stadium. On Sunday in the same stadium, the Patriots led the Bengals by the same score. Patriots quickly boosted a 24-3 halftime lead to 31-3 on Brandon Tate's touchdown. Bengals cut that to 31-17 on Carson Palmer's scoring passes of 1 yard to rookie tight end Jermaine Gresham midway through the third quarter and 28 yards to Ochocinco with 22 seconds remaining in the period. Then, Tom Brady regained control by leading a 14-play, 81-yard march that was capped by a 1-yard scoring pass to Rob Gronkowski, another rookie tight end. It was his first pro touchdown and, before lining up to block for the extra point, he handed the ball to Tom Brady for safekeeping on the sideline. Tom Brady completed 25 of 35 passes for 258 yards. Carson Palmer, forced to throw because of the big deficit, finished 34 for 50 for 345 yards and two touchdowns. Ochocinco had 12 catches for 159 yards, and Terrell Owens added seven receptions for 53 yards. \"Apologies to Cincy fans,\" Terrell Owens tweeted, \"tough loss today, only week 1, we've a long season ahead, all of you be blessed, 1 luv.\" Cedric Benson scored on a 1-yard run for Bengals with 3:57 left in the game. While the Patriots' offense was expected to be strong, the young defense was suspect but was very stingy in the first half. The Bengals' first five possessions ended with three punts, a lost fumble and Gary Guyton's touchdown that made it 24-0 with 5:38 left in the half. On their first offensive play, Carson Palmer threw about 35 yards down the left sideline toward Terrell Owens. Rookie cornerback Devin McCourty, a first-round draft pick, stayed with him step for step and broke up the play. \"Devin is a real mature kid,\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. \"He's still got a lot to learn, but he's done a good job for us.\" On the Patriots' first offensive play, Wes Welker caught a 5-yard pass over the middle. He ended that drive with a 9-yard touchdown. Stephen Gostkowski's 32-yard field goal made it 10-0, and Wes Welker struck again with a 4-yard scoring catch about 6 minutes into the second quarter. \"I feel like it was just another game,\" Wes Welker said. \"You go out there preparing and, you know,'This is the big comeback or whatever,' but for me it was just going out there and playing and be out there with my teammates and trying to contribute to a win.\" Game notes Wes Welker has at least six catches in 27 of his last 31 games....

Chris Johnson ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns, Vince Young threw for two TDs and Javon Ringer had a TD, and the Titans quickly avoided mimicking their 0-6 start of 2009 by routing the Raiders 38-13 Sunday in the opener. \"That's one of the biggest games of the season, getting that first win in the first week,\" Vince Young said. \"We did a great job executing the plays today. Our defense did a phenomenal job putting a lot of pressure on them.\" Titans answered with 24 straight points to take control. The Titans also sacked new Raiders quarterback Jason Campbell four times and forced two turnovers they turned into 10 points. Raiders had just 106 yards of total offense at halftime. Chris Johnson, the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year, extended his streak to 12 consecutive 100-yard games by halftime to break a tie with Marcus Allen. He trails only Barry Sanders, who had an NFL-best 14 such games. It was a nice change from a year ago when the Titans opened the season losing their first six games. They rallied by winning eight of their final 10 to become the first team in NFL history to finish at.500 after such a woeful start. \"That's momentum just carrying onto this year, and hopefully it can carry on throughout this year,\" Chris Johnson said. The Raiders came in with a new quarterback and new faces on a defense that had been 29th in the NFL against the run. None of the changes helped. The Titans ran for 205 of their 345 yards total offense. \"You can't sit around and feel bad about it or be shocked by it,\" Raiders coach Tom Cable said. \"You really have to deal with it. This was unexpected, but we'll fix it and get it right pretty quick.\" Kamerion Wimbley stripped Vince Young of the ball on the Titans' opening series, and Richard Seymour recovered and went 13 yards to the Titans 34. Titans linebacker Will Witherspoon, who flew back on owner Bud Adams' jet for this opener after the death of his mother, sacked Jason Campbell on the Raiders' first play after the turnover. \"The fact it happened early is really one of those great release moments,'All right, I'm on top of things. I feel good about it. Yeah, let's go,'\" Will Witherspoon said of the sack. The Titans thought they had held when rookie Derrick Morgan sacked Jason Campbell on third down. But Derrick Morgan was falling down and drew a personal foul for a low hit on the quarterback, giving the Raiders a first down. They settled for a field goal. Sebastian Janikowski yanked his 39-yard attempt wide right, but Cortland Finnegan jumped offside to give him another chance. Titans answered quickly as Vince Young caught the Raiders biting on a playaction fake to Chris Johnson and found Nate Redskins wide-open for a 56-yard TD, and Vince Young finished 13 of 17 for 154 yards. \"A lot of teams in this league are going to be fearful of what he can do,\" Redskins said of Chris Johnson. \"When he faked it to Chris, I was able to see the safety and corner bite down. I was just able to run right by them.\" The scoring continued as Rob Bironas added a 43-yard field goal after another Jason Campbell sack and fumble. Then Ringer scored the first TD of his NFL career with a 15-yard run, and Chris Johnson scored on the Titans' next offensive play. He followed tight end Bo Scaife's block and streaked upfield 76 yards for the fourth-longest TD run of his career, celebrating by high-stepping the last 10 yards for a 24-3 lead. Chris Johnson added a 4-yard TD in the third, and Vince Young tossed a 1-yard TD pass to Bo Scaife three plays after Chris Hope intercepted Jason Campbell. \"We have to eliminate the penalties,\" Jason Campbell said. \"We can't turn it over.\" The Raiders, with rookie center Jared Veldheer making his NFL debut, struggled mightily on offense. Bad snaps both with Jason Campbell in the shotgun and under center, and Raiders didn't get into positive yards passing with all the sacks until a 63-yard drive just before halftime for Sebastian Janikowski's second field goal of the game. \"I thought we were catching everything rather than taking the fight to them,\" Tom Cable said. Raiders did drive 80 yards for a TD in the fourth quarter. But that was it for a team that won four of its five games with fourth-quarter rallies last season. Game notes Chris Johnson has nine runs of 50 yards or longer in his career.... He also tied for needing the fourth-fewest games in NFL history to 4,000 yards from scrimmage, reaching that mark in his 32nd career game.... This was Vince Young's ninth career game with two or more TD passes, and the Titans are 8-1 in those games.... Redskins's TD catch was longer than any reception he had in 2009....

Arian Foster, who spent most of last season on the practice squad, ran for a team record 231 yards and scored three touchdowns to carry the Texans to a 34-24 victory over the defending AFC champion Colts on Sunday. \"Coming into the league, you don't know what to expect, especially if you are not heralded and there's not a lot of publicity,\" Arian Foster said. \"You see guys like Andre Johnson and Matt Schaub and the way they carry themselves, and you try to mimic it and make your own personality. I feel privileged to be here.\" Arian Foster had the NFL's second-best opening weekend rushing performance since 1933, topped only by O.J. Simpson's 250 for Bills in 1973 against Patriots. He also surpassed Domanick Davis' team record of 158 yards, set in 2004 at Jaguars. The Texans (1-0) ran for a franchise record 257 yards and backed up their bold talk in the offseason that they were ready to challenge Colts. The Colts came into the game with 15 wins in 16 games in the series, including rallying from 17 points down in the previous two meetings in Texans. \"We had to have patience,\" Arian Foster said. \"It didn't feel like I was going to be able to get going early, but you keep pounding and pounding, and they start getting a little tired and we start getting a little tired. It's a test of wills.\" Arian Foster, acquired by the Texans last summer, had 33 carries in gaining the most yards by a Colts' opponent. \"We failed to rise to the occasion, which we don't normally do,\" Colts linebacker Clint Session said. \"We normally get out of these kinds of games, but we couldn't do it.\" Peyton Manning completed 40 of 57 passes for 433 yards and three touchdowns, the fourth-highest opening weekend passing yards total since 1933, and three touchdowns. He threw a 10-yard TD pass to Cowboys Clark with 4:52 left to cut Texans's lead to 27-17. But Arian Foster ran for 41 yards on the Texans' next series and capped his day with an 8-yard TD run. The Texans ranked 30th in rushing last season, and building a ground attack was a focal point at training camp. Arian Foster beat out Steve Slaton for the number 1 running back spot, despite spending the first 10 games of last season on the practice squad. \"We heard all offseason that our running game wasn't efficient,\" Arian Foster said. \"You can either let it get to you, or let it get in you, and I feel like we let it get in us, and we used it.\" Texans led 13-10 at halftime and turned the offense over to Arian Foster to start the third quarter. He rushed 10 times for 49 yards on the drive, finishing the eight-minute march with a 1-yard touchdown run. \"At halftime, we talked about the key to the game being the most physical team and our offensive line,\" Texans coach Gary Kubiak said. \"That's what you want as a coach. You want those guys walking the sideline saying,'Run the ball, coach.' \" The Colts' offensive line protected Peyton Manning better in the second half than it did in the first, and Peyton Manning guided Colts inside the Texans 30. Mario Williams sacked Peyton Manning on third down from the Texans 27, driving the Colts out of field-goal range. Mario Williams has sacked Peyton Manning six times since 2006, the most by any player. \"We had great preparation this week,\" Mario Williams said. \"We studied film and figured stuff out for ourselves. It was pretty much on-the-go. Some of the things we did out there was,'Hey, you do this, and I'll do that.' It was unorthodox, but it worked.\" The Colts punted, and Arian Foster went over 100 yards with an 11-yard run to open the Texans' next possession. But Matt Schaub threw incomplete to Andre Johnson on third down, and Colts got it back with just over 12 minutes left. Peyton Manning completed four straight passes to move the Colts across midfield. On third down, Austin Collie caught a pass from Peyton Manning at the Texans' 10, but fumbled after a hit by safety Bernard Pollard and cornerback Glover Quin recovered. By then, even Peyton Manning was doubting whether the Colts had another unlikely comeback in Texans within reach. \"We've had some crazy games here in the past, where we've been down a number of points and we've come back, so it wasn't totally unfamiliar territory,\" he said. \"We just didn't do enough as a group to kind of help each other out when one unit was struggling. That's something we've done in the past. That's something we're going to need to do starting next week.\" Arian Foster broke a 42-yard run on the next play. Slaton and Arian Foster gained first downs on consecutive runs before Arian Foster sprinted 25 yards to the end zone for a 27-10 lead with 8:41 left. The Texans had been here before. Two years ago, Texans blew a 27-10 lead in the fourth quarter when backup Sage Rosenfels had three turnovers. The Colts scored 21 points in just over two minutes and won 31-27. Right tackle Eric Winston glanced at tight end Owen Daniels at that point on Sunday, and knew what he was thinking. \"We still remember the day when we looked at each other, too, thinking,'We got this one,' and it didn't happen,\" Eric Winston said. \"A lot of guys just said,'Hey, 60 minutes, 60 minutes.' That really helped.\" Peyton Manning found Clark for a 10-yard touchdown with 4:52 left on Sunday. Instead of letting it slip away, the Texans went back to Arian Foster and put the game away. Arian Foster ran 41 yards on the drive through more huge holes. He strutted into the end zone for his final score and slammed the ball as his teammates mobbed him. Peyton Manning threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to Collie with 1:27 left. Matt Schaub only had to kneel on two snaps to secure the victory.

Tom Brady escaped serious injury in a car wreck, picked up an extra $72 million and systematically picked apart the Bengals as though he were playing football in his neighbor's backyard. \"He's just so calm out there,\" Bengals cornerback Johnathan Joseph said in the wake of Patriots's 38-24 win. \"I know he had a lot going on, but he's a Class A professional, so it didn't seem to bother him. I mean, the guy has been down this road before.\" The feeling in the Bengals locker room was that if the defense could get to Tom Brady early, then perhaps that wonderful deterrent -- doubt -- would creep into a young Patriots huddle. The worst-case scenario was to allow the Patriots to sprint out to an early lead and force Carson Palmer and his charges to play catch-up. Tom Brady came in with a checklist of his own concerns. Logan Mankins (contract holdout) and Nick Kaczur (injured) were missing from his normally redoubtable offensive line. He was mindful that Wes Welker, who admitted he was not at 100 percent, would need some early catches to build his confidence after major knee surgery. He was breaking in a new group of tight ends, including rookie Rob Gronkowski. The first series, he reminded them, was critical. And, as it turned out, it was vintage Tom Brady. Three passes, three completions and a touchdown. By halftime, the Patriots were up 24-3 and Tom Brady already had racked up 178 passing yards and two touchdowns (both to Wes Welker). Everything Bengals had discussed avoiding had happened, and it was at the hands of Tom Brady. \"He's just so consistent, consistent, consistent,\" safety Chris Crocker said. \"He trusts his guys, and he trusts his system.\" The Patriots offensive line, which was an obvious question mark heading into this game, quickly transformed itself into an exclamation point. Tom Brady was given ample time to throw and wasn't sacked at all. In fact, the Bengals only knocked him down twice. As a result, the Bengals secondary was forced to play defense for 8, 9, even 10 seconds. \"Ten seconds or 1 second -- it doesn't matter,\" said cornerback Leon Hall. \"They just flat-out beat us. It was stuff we've seen before. \"But [with Tom Brady], even when a guy is covered, he pinpoints it.\" This game will not go down as a Tom Brady masterpiece. He made some sloppy throws, but still finished with 258 yards on 25-of-35 passing. He connected with seven receivers, five of them on multiple occasions. He did so after expertly deflecting the distractions of a summer of contract talks, as well as shaking off the effects of a car accident Thursday morning that left him shaken but unhurt. This was no fender bender; a passenger in the other vehicle, which reportedly ran a red light, was hospitalized. Tom Brady acknowledged that it was a scary moment, particularly given that most of his family is on West Coast time and awoke to a flurry of text messages regarding the accident. \"I called my dad pretty quick and just said,'I'm fine.'\" He was more than fine on this Sunday, which represents a new beginning for a young team that will look to the quarterback for calmness and consistency throughout a grueling NFL season. Tom Brady has a new contract, a new car and a new winning streak. Not a bad week after all.

We'll try not to criticize the Bears for being happy about their 19-14 season-opening victory over the Lions on Sunday, if they promise not to be surprised by our continued skepticism. After one of the stranger, more hollow victories in recent memory, we have little choice. How, for example, are we supposed to applaud the Bears' offense for racking up 262 yards passing in the first half alone, when they couldn't punch it in from the Lions' half-yard line on four attempts in the fourth quarter? How much satisfaction is there to take from a last-minute victory when it occurred despite four turnovers, four sacks against, nine penalties for 100 yards and an officials' call that while apparently was by the book, also defied all rules of common sense and poetic justice? The Bears would not even cop to relief after this one. \"Normally, things will end up in favor of the best team that day,\" Bears coach Lovie Smith said. That's one way to look at it. Here are a few others: While the passing game piled up gaudy yards -- 89 on a catch-and-run off a screen pass to Forte -- Johnny Knox often looked out of place and confused, and Devin Aromashodu allowed a perfect pass from Jay Cutler go through his hands in the corner of the end zone on the first series of the game. And after the Bears went less than nowhere in three consecutive attempts from inside the 1-yard line in the fourth quarter -- once over right guard, once over left guard and once on an incomplete pass from Jay Cutler to Greg Olsen -- Lovie Smith passed up a go-ahead, 18-yard field goal attempt to try again on fourth down. Raise your hand if you were surprised that Forte was stopped over right tackle for no gain. This was, by far, the most baffling and ugliest moment of the day for the eventual winners. Not surprisingly, a defiant Lovie Smith defended the call. \"I felt like we could still make them punt and get good field position,\" he said. \"It's a field position game throughout. I make that call every time.\" Bears center Olin Kreutz, like his teammates, did not second-guess his coach. But he did not back off from blame either. \"We got our [butt] kicked,\" Olin Kreutz said. \"They beat us down there.... Your coach can't help you down there.... It's not rocket science on the goal line. They call a play, and you've got to win down there, period. \"Is that acceptable? Do we have to get better at that? Yes. Can you win in the NFL every week if you're getting beat on the 1-yard line? No. These are all obvious statements.\" Olin Kreutz also freely copped to the unavoidable fact that while the Bears' offense gained 463 yards, it was hardly a scoring juggernaut, coming away with two field goals on four trips inside the red zone. \"Yards don't win games, points do,\" he said. \"I'd rather have 100 yards and 25 points. We're moving the ball and not scoring points.\" Defensively, the Bears did leave fans with some confidence, as linebackers Lance Briggs and Brian Urlacher combined for 18 tackles. Lance Briggs' forced fumble and recovery to set up the failed goal-line scenario was almost worth the price of admission. Even the Bears' secondary performed well beyond expectations but was put in a horrible position on Calvin Johnson's disallowed 25-yard catch in the end zone that surely would have given the Lions the victory with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Cornerback Zack Bowman was in man coverage on Calvin Johnson on the play, with strong safety Danieal Manning in no position to make a play, nor was it his responsibility in the Cover 3 to get there in time. The officials contend the receiver did not maintain possession \"throughout the entire possession of the catch.\" Calvin Johnson looked as though he possessed the ball long enough to contemplate spiking it at the end. \"My stomach made a turn,\" Lance Briggs said of the apparent catch. \"I hate stuff like that. It reminded me of the Packers game last year. We played great defense all game and then we gave up one big play.\" Surely Bears fans could relate to the stomach-turning part. Every time you wanted to get excited about something the Bears did well, like scoring 10 points in the final 63 seconds of the first half to close the gap to 14-13, you were forced to take notice of some other unavoidable realities. Even the Bears' best performers Sunday made costly mistakes. While Julius Peppers contributed to consistent pressure on starting quarterback Matthew Stafford -- knocking him out of the game late in the first half -- as well as backup qb Shaun Hill, it was Julius Peppers' silly roughing-the-passer penalty on a third-and-8 from the Bears' 40 which prolonged the Lions' second drive of the game and eventually resulted in a 7-yard touchdown run by Lions rookie Jahvid Best. And it was a fumble by Forte in the second quarter -- one of two for him on the day -- that gave the Lions the ball on their own 40-yard line, a drive that culminated in a 4-yard touchdown run by Jahvid Best to give Lions a 14-3 lead. \"We feel like we almost gave it away, but we're just happy we got the win,\" Forte said. \"I think going further in the season, we're going to correct those mistakes. That's the type of offense this is. We have a lot of talented guys. If we can eliminate mistakes and turnovers, we'll be that good.\" Blaming Forte for anything on a day in which he also had 151 receiving yards on seven catches, including the game winner on a twisting 28-yard grab in the corner of the end zone with 1:32 remaining, makes less sense than the Bears' win. But saying the Bears were lucky to prevail with breaks, mistakes and four turnovers is fair game, though Tommie Harris had the perfect rationalization on this imperfect day. \"[Usually], whoever wins the turnover ratio [wins the game],\" Harris said. \"We didn't win that and that's what makes it ugly. But it's still good to have more turnovers than the other team and still win the game, so that's a good thing. That shows you that we have to improve and we can beat ourselves, not the other [guys].\" Perfect.

LOUIS -- The Sam Bradford era began with promise. Then Larry Fitzgerald went and spoiled it. The Cardinals' Pro Bowl wide receiver, held in check most of the game after limited work in the preseason because of a knee injury, got loose for a go-ahead 21-yard touchdown catch with 6:13 to play, rescuing a sloppy opener for the two-time defending NFC West champions in a 17-13 victory over the Rams on Sunday. The Cardinals lost four fumbles. \"We've got a ways to go,\" Larry Fitzgerald said. \"I've got to get my body together first. We're glad to get a win and get out of here.\" Derek Anderson hung in the pocket despite taking a pounding from the Rams pass rush that sacked him twice, going 22 for 41 for 297 yards in his first start as the replacement for the retired Kurt Warner. Steve Breaston caught seven passes for a career-best 132 yards, and made a touchdown-saving play in the third quarter that would have put the Rams up by 10 points, stripping defensive lineman Clifton Ryan just short of the end zone after one of the fumbles. \"Plays like that, you don't know what's going to happen and how it's going to affect the game,\" Steve Breaston said. \"You just have to go after the ball in a situation like that.\" Tim Hightower and LaRod Stephens-Howling combined for 103 yards rushing for an offense without Beanie Wells (knee), although Tim Hightower lost two fumbles. Adrian Wilson made three big plays for the Cardinals defense to cancel out the offensive miscues, including his second interception to end the game. He's the first player since Julius Peppers in 2004 to get a sack, interception and blocked field goal in the same game. The 226-pound Adrian Wilson described the opening on his block: \"It's kind of hard for me to get skinny, but I got skinny and I got in there.\" Sam Bradford, selected the starter a week ago after two impressive preseason efforts, was 32 of 55 for 253 yards and three interceptions. \"Obviously, I'm disappointed about the loss,\" Sam Bradford said. \"I thought I handled some things well, didn't handle some things well.\" The Rams (0-1) displayed daring on Sam Bradford's 1-yard touchdown pass to Laurent Robinson on the final play of the half to tie it at 10. A sellout crowd was roaring after the Rams took the lead on Josh Brown's chip-shot field goal midway through the third quarter, before Rams lost its 14th in a row at home. The Rams have lost 15 straight to NFC West opponents and eight straight to the Cardinals. \"It was good to have the crowd behind us,\" running back Steven Jackson said. \"It's been a while since we've had that kind of energy in the dome. \"But when a team is making mistakes we have to be able to capitalize on it.\" The Cardinals, the two-time defending division champions, had to hold off two late Rams charges. Kerry Rhodes' interception on fourth-and-10 from the Cardinals 21 just after the two-minute warning appeared to be the clincher, but Tim Hightower's fumble gave the Rams another chance that finally fizzled when Adrian Wilson intercepted Sam Bradford's last-ditch throw from the Cardinals 36 in the end zone as time ran out. Larry Fitzgerald was held in check by cornerback Ronald Bartell much of the game and had only three receptions for 43 yards. He finally shook free on the touchdown grab with 6:13 to go. \"You can put that one on me,\" Bartell said. Steve Breaston's fourth career 100-yard game, and first since 2008, picked up the slack. Mark Clayton, acquired from the Ravens on Monday, had a career-high 10 receptions for 119 yards for Rams. Cardinals had totaled 12 yards rushing before putting together a 76-yard drive, all five plays on rushes, to take a 10-3 lead in the second quarter. Stephens-Howling had two carries for 36 yards and Tim Hightower had a 20-yard carry to the 1 before taking it in the next play. Adrian Wilson's first career block thwarted the Rams after Tim Hightower was stripped on a carry by Oshiomoghe Atogwe on Cardinals's first drive. Bradley Fletcher returned the ball 43 yards to the Cardinals 32. Adrian Wilson has 21 1/2 career sacks, 7 1/2 coming against the Rams. He has five career games with a sack and an interception, including two straight games against the Rams.

They were the kind of boos that made Philly fans famous. But not even Donovan McNabb, discarded in the offseason for a pair of non-first-round draft picks, had a Eagles starting debut like this. Kevin Kolb got booed, got a concussion and got replaced. So what happens? Michael Vick, the guy who replaced the guy who replaced Donovan McNabb, almost -- almost -- got the win. And because of it, the Eagles have an instant quarterback controversy -- or not, depending on the severity of Kevin Kolb's concussion and the level of commitment of Philly coach Andy Reid. What a bizarre, strangely compelling game this was. Just when you wanted to nod off, the Eagles made it interesting for us and way too interesting for the Packers. What had been a 17-point Packers lead midway through the third quarter somehow morphed into the Eagles having the ball and a chance to tie the score in the final two minutes. It didn't happen. On fourth-and-1 at the Packers' 42, Michael Vick was stuffed like cheesesteak into a roll. Packers got the ball, and Aaron Rodgers genuflected three times before the clock ran out. The Packers left with a 27-20 win, but it wasn't anything Aaron Rodgers is going to put on his Facebook page. Packers could have blown out the Eagles, but didn't. The Eagles had a chance to send the game into overtime, but couldn't. Now Philly enters Week 2 with a quarterback question, all sorts of injuries and some explaining to do. First, the quarterback question. Kevin Kolb played awful -- and that was before Packers linebacker Clay Matthews drove him into the turf like a tent stake. He completed 5 of 10 passes for 24 yards and was sacked twice. Had it been Donovan McNabb, he would have gotten a higher volume of quality boos. \"I feel real bad for the guy,\" said Eagles wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. \"He was more excited than anybody to go out there and play. We still have faith in him.\" Kevin Kolb wasn't in a chatty mood afterward. As reporters approached his locker, an Eagles official made the universal hand gesture for, \"He's not talking.\" But had Kevin Kolb talked, he would have been asked about the concussion, his future availability and, more importantly, why in the world he was allowed to return briefly to the game after the concussion. In fact, both Kevin Kolb and Eagles linebacker Stewart Bradley re-entered the game after suffering concussions. Stewart Bradley's return was especially strange, given that he had collapsed on the field like a punch-drunk boxer immediately after his injury. Andy Reid said they were cleared by team doctors to play again. But it wasn't long before Kevin Kolb told Michael Vick that he \"wasn't seeing things very clearly.\" Stewart Bradley also was unable to continue. Given the NFL's sensitivity toward concussion-related injuries, it will be interesting to see whether the league makes any inquiries about the Eagles' injury protocol. At the very least, Kevin Kolb's and Stewart Bradley's statuses for Week 2 remain uncertain. So what do you think was going through Donovan McNabb's mind -- and you know he must have sneaked some peeks -- when Kevin Kolb got booed? Or when Michael Vick almost pulled off the comeback? Or when the Eagles lost? We'll likely never find out. Donovan McNabb wears a Redskins uniform now and has yet to rip his former team. Airing dirty laundry has never been his style. But here's guessing he felt a certain satisfaction, a tinge of sadness and possibly a sense of relief. This is Kevin Kolb's team now. At least that's what Andy Reid said after the game. Asked point-blank whether Kevin Kolb was still the starting quarterback (if healthy), Andy Reid answered, \"Yes.\" The Eagles and Andy Reid have so much invested in Kevin Kolb that they almost don't have a choice but to stick with him. After all, Eagles management chose Kevin Kolb over Donovan McNabb. It wasn't so much that the Eagles didn't want Donovan McNabb. It was more that they didn't need him. They had younger Kevin Kolb fueled up and ready to go. And behind Kevin Kolb, they had Michael Vick, the left-handed safety net/reclamation project. As it turned out, the Eagles needed the safety net to keep Sunday's game respectable. Michael Vick, little more than an accessory in Andy Reid's offense a season ago and 30 years old, played the entire second half and played fairly well. He led everyone on the field in rushing (103 yards) and completed 16 of 24 passes for 175 yards and a touchdown. \"I think Michael did a phenomenal job today,\" Andy Reid said. \"He brought the team back; he kept his poise; and he had some big runs and he made some big throws. I'm happy as heck for Michael. I'm not looking to the future. I'm trying to get [the offense] fixed so that we can win some football games here.\" In case you're wondering whether Michael Vick thinks he should be the starter, he does. He was polite about it, but there was no mistaking his postgame message. \"Hopefully, like I said, I still feel like I can play at a high level,\" Michael Vick said. \"I feel like if I had been out there for four quarters, maybe we would have had a chance to win the game. But it's all hindsight now. I feel like I'm 25 or 26 again, even though that's not the case.\" The Eagles need something or somebody. They lost Pro Bowl fullback Leonard Weaver to a torn ACL. So gruesome was the injury that Eagles players had to look away when it was shown not once, but twice on the stadium big screen. They lost center Jamaal Jackson to a torn biceps and Kevin Kolb and Stewart Bradley to concussions. And they lost a game. \"I think we all had a piece of this [defeat],\" Andy Reid said. \"And like I mentioned before, I need to make sure that I put all of them in the right position.\" Here's an idea for the Week 2 game at Lions: Put Michael Vick in the starting quarterback position.

History proves it. In each of the past seven seasons, and in nine of the 10 seasons of this decade, one of the NFL's last-place teams has gone from worst to first. Chances are, it will happen again. Maybe it's the Bills. Or the Browns. Or the Jaguars. Or the Chiefs. Or the Redskins. Or the Lions. Or the Buccaneers. Or the Rams. Usually a surprise team comes from the NFC South, which has had one of its teams go from worst to first in six of the past seven years, including last season, when Saints finished first at 13-3 and won the Super Bowl one year after finishing last at 8-8. You wonder, How could it happen? But it happens almost every year. On to the rest of the 10 Spot: For years, the Colts struggled to beat the Patriots. Now, the Colts must become to the Texans what Patriots once was to Colts. The Colts are the team that the Texans must dethrone. To date, Texans has failed. The Texans are 1-15 all time against the Colts, including six straight losses. Making it worse is the manner in which they've lost. In the teams' past two games in Texans, the Texans have blown a 17-point lead in each loss. So even if the Texans storm out of the gate, they know that no lead is safe against Peyton Manning. Until the Texans can knock off the Colts, Colts will continue a run of dominance the NFL seldom has seen. The Colts have advanced to the playoffs in each of the past eight seasons and, if they go again this season, they would join Cowboys from 1975-83 as the only team to go to the playoffs in nine straight seasons. Colts also is trying to become the first team to win at least 12 games in eight consecutive seasons. No team is more consistently inconsistent at quarterback than Browns. Since the Browns returned in 1999, they have started eight quarterbacks on opening day. Jake Delhomme will become the ninth. The Browns have gone from Ty Detmer to Tim Couch to Kelly Holcomb to Jeff Garcia to Trent Dilfer to Charlie Frye to Derek Anderson to Brady Quinn to Delhomme. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Packers, which has had two starting quarterbacks the past 18 seasons. The Packers have been consistently consistent at quarterback, which is why they are one of the favorites this season to get to the Super Bowl. Of course, quarterbacks such as Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers make that easy. Brett Favre became a legend in Packers; Aaron Rodgers is one of the best young quarterbacks in the game today. His accuracy this preseason was off the charts. He heads into this season as a potential MVP candidate. On a late July day, Carson Palmer sat at a table overlooking the Bengals' training camp field in Georgetown, Ky., and admitted he had to prove this season that he still deserved to be included in the discussion of the game's top quarterbacks. This is his chance, his time. The Bengals signed wide receiver Terrell Owens. They drafted tight end Jermaine Gresham in the first round and wide receiver Jordan Shipley in the third. Each could wind up playing a big role for the defending AFC North champions. But Carson Palmer remains the most significant figure in Bengals. One scout said this summer that Carson Palmer didn't look as sharp as he did in the prime of his career. In his past 21 games, Carson Palmer has thrown for more than 300 yards only once. It didn't stop the Bengals from winning the division last season. But it could derail them this postseason. Kids grow up fast these days, but not any faster than NFL quarterbacks. In each of the past two seasons, a rookie quarterback has helped lead his team to multiple playoff wins. First Joe Flacco did it for the Ravens during the 2008 season, then Mark Sanchez did it for the Jets last season. If the trend continues, there will be a rookie quarterback who defies his age and the odds and marches his team to and through the postseason. The only rookie quarterback starting opening day is Sam Bradford for Rams. Other rookie quarterbacks who could be called on at some point in time are Broncos's Tim Tebow, Panthers's Jimmy Clausen, Browns's Colt McCoy and Cardinals's Max Hall. Of that group, Hall is the least known and the most likely to succeed this season. The 24-year-old Hall has impressed the Cardinals from the start of camp. \"I like the way he competes,\" said Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt. \"Those are qualities that do mirror Kurt [Warner]. Maybe they come from similar type starts, where people didn't think they could play and they've had to work against the odds and somehow they prevailed.\" Of course Tim Tebow's first NFL game would come at EverBank Field in Jaguars, 20 minutes from where he grew up and excelled in college. Tim Tebow played four games for Florida there against Georgia and posted a 3-1 record. His performance in that stadium was as good as his statistics. Tim Tebow completed 39 of 56 passes (69.6 percent) for 554 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions. Tim Tebow also carried the ball 49 times for 145 yards and seven touchdowns. Tim Tebow certainly will have his share of his support Sunday. He came up with roughly 50 tickets for Sunday's game. No one will be surprised if the crowd is wearing more number 15 jerseys than the combined number of Jaguars jerseys. Ravens traded for wide receiver Anquan Boldin. It signed wide receivers T.J. Houshmandzadeh and Donte' Stallworth. Yet it still is all about the defense in Ravens. Though some suspect the Ravens' defense has aged and isn't quite what it has been with Pro Bowl safety Ed Reed on the physically unable to perform list for at least six weeks, evidence points to the contrary. The Ravens' first-string defense did not allow a touchdown all preseason. Yet much of the focus for Monday night's game against the Jets is on the Jets' defense with its newly signed cornerback Darrelle Revis. But the Ravens sound happy that Darrelle Revis has returned. \"I'm glad they got him back so there won't be any excuses,\" said Ravens fullback Le'Ron McClain. Doubling up at wide receiver. In recent seasons, we've seen two Steve Smiths -- one in Panthers, the other in New York -- perform at a Pro Bowl level. Now, two Mike Williamses -- one in Seahawks, the other in Buccaneers -- could be on the verge of becoming their teams' number 1 wide receivers. The Mike Williams in Seahawks has lit it up this summer, becoming the type of wide receiver the Lions thought they were getting when they selected him with the 10th overall pick in the 2005 draft. The Seahawks believe that, if he can keep the edge he has had all summer, Mike Williams can catch 80 passes. The Mike Williams in Tampa has impressed the Buccaneers from the time they drafted him. One Bucs official said midway through training camp that Mike Williams already was the team's best wide receiver. By the way, the Steve Smith's teams meet each other Sunday. From the time Cowboys owner Jerry Jones bypassed the chance to draft wide receiver Randy Moss in 1998, he has been on a mission to make up for it. Now he feels he finally might have. In April, the Cowboys traded up in the draft to nab former Oklahoma State standout wide receiver Dez Bryant. Cowboys expects Dez Bryant to be worthy of the number 88 Cowboys jersey he was given. But at least early on, expectations should be tempered. Wide receivers do not have a history of conquering the league in their rookie year. Only four rookies since 1997 have topped 1,000 yards receiving: Moss (1998), Anquan Boldin (2003), Michael Clayton (2004) and Marques Colston (2006). Dez Bryant has the chance to be great. But consider the rookie numbers of former Cowboys standout wide receiver Michael Irvin, who also wore number 88. During his rookie year, Irvin caught 32 passes for 654 yards. There will be notable absences when teams take the field in Week 1. The Chargers must do without Pro Bowl wide receiver Vincent Jackson and Pro Bowl offensive tackle Marcus McNeill, each of whom wants a long-term contract extension. The Patriots are playing without Pro Bowl guard Logan Mankins, who also wants an extension. The Steelers will be without the suspended quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for four games. The Jets will be without wide receiver Santonio Holmes for the same amount of time. And the Texans must get by for four games without last season's Defensive Rookie of the Year, Brian Cushing. The feeling around the league is that Vincent Jackson, Marcus McNeill and Logan Mankins each might have played his last game for his current team. But Chargers might not miss its absent players much, at least not early. The Chargers open the season Monday night at Chiefs, host Jaguars, play at Seahawks, host Cardinals, then travel to Raiders and Rams. There's not a game in that bunch in which the Chargers will be underdogs. One of the league's only certainties is its uncertainty. Proof: For 14 consecutive seasons at least five teams made the playoffs that did not qualify the year before. Here are five worthy choices for this season: 1) Falcons -- No team ever has repeated as the NFC South champion, and the Falcons are the second-best team in the division; 2) Giants -- There are questions along the offensive line, but there also are improvements that have been made across the roster; 3) 49ers -- With Kurt Warner retired in Cardinals, the division is ripe for 49ers; 4) Dolphins -- It's a tough division, but the Dolphins have built a tough team; 5) Texans -- The Texans were the sleeper pick last season and might be ready to achieve some of those expectations this season. Game of the week: Packers vs. Eagles -- As Kevin Kolb takes over for Donovan McNabb, he tries to do it as smoothly and efficiently as the quarterback he squares off against Sunday. Player of the week: Texans running back Arian Foster -- The more Arian Foster piles up yards, the less chance Colts quarterback Peyton Manning can do the same. Upset of the week: Redskins over Cowboys -- Anyone who has watched Redskins coach Mike Shanahan for years knows he is most lethal with months to prepare for an opponent.

In the preseason, Matt Cassel was 19-for-34 with no touchdowns and one interception. He struggled so much that there were rumblings that the Patriots might have to find a new backup to Tom Brady. One quarter into the season, however, Tom Brady went down with a knee injury, and Matt Cassel established himself as an NFL starter by winning 11 games. So who could be the next Matt Cassel, who took over the Patriots after being an unknown career backup and never started a game in college or during his first four years in the NFL? The best guess is Brett Ratliff of the Browns, nudging out Matt Moore of the Panthers and possibly Colt Brennan of the Redskins. Ratliff fits Matt Cassel's profile. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, he has decent size and a strong arm. Last summer, as the number 3 quarterback for the Jets, he created some excitement in preseason games, going 32-for-47 with four touchdown passes. Because he's playing behind Tom Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson, Ratliff probably will have to wait until next season to be the Browns' number 2 quarterback. It's pretty clear, though, that new Browns coach Eric Mangini has plans for him. Eric Mangini included Ratliff when he brought as many Jets to Browns as he could. Like Aaron Rodgers of the Packers, Ratliff had to grow up as an on-the-field leader at a very young age. He followed Aaron Rodgers to Butte College, a junior college loaded with older offensive starters. Like many junior colleges, Butte had offensive linemen in their late 20s. As Aaron Rodgers and Ratliff will tell you, it's not easy being an 18-year-old quarterback fresh out of high school trying to lead players who are significantly older. Ratliff succeeded. He started for two seasons at Butte and had one year in which he threw 35 touchdowns and passed for 3,651 yards. That earned him a scholarship at Utah, where he spent one year as a backup and another as the starter on an 8-5 team. Eric Mangini and the Jets signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2007 and started developing him on the practice squad. The state of backup quarterbacks in the NFL is bad. Eight teams have backups who have never won an NFL game. With Byron Leftwich now the starter in Buccaneers, only four teams have a backup with a winning career record. Finding the next Matt Cassel is a guessing game. In Panthers, the Panthers believe they are developing another Tony Romo in Matt Moore. Brennan has shown a flair for moving the football in his time on the field during the preseason. The Patriots really didn't know what they had in Matt Cassel until Tom Brady went down and they had no choice but to play him. We'll see whether Ratliff will get a similar opportunity in the next couple of years.

I never had trouble in any given week coming up with my top 10 players as there were plenty to choose from. However, what has been difficult is coming up with my rookie of the year. This was a close race between primarily two players, with either Vikings WR Percy Harvin and Ravens OT Michael Oher holding down the top spot in the rankings on a weekly basis. Michael Oher Percy Harvin has held down more weeks in the top spot, but Michael Oher made a late push and that is why I am going to go with him as my rookie of the year. Offensive linemen do not get enough credit in the rookie of the year balloting. We saw this a few years ago when the honor should have gone to Chargers LT Marcus McNeill. There are no real stats to gage an offensive lineman. There is not a stat for sacks allowed. A big reason for that is because defensive linemen sometimes stunt up front and it can be tough to tell who actually gives up a sack unless you just flat out see the defensive end run by an offensive tackle on the island. The bottom line is that nobody consistently could turn the corner on Michael Oher this season. He possesses excellent foot quickness, agility and balance. He was as effective versus the speed rush as he was the bull rush. Due to injury he at one point had to move over to the left side and looked as comfortable on the right side. For that reason Michael Oher is my rookie of the year. Here is the rest of the top 10:", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=4797773", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Percy Harvin", "Ravens", "Michael Oher", "Chargers", "Marcus McNeill"]}, {"title": "Colts, Chargers clearly superior in AFC", "author": "John Clayton", "date": "Jan 3, 2010", "content": "From the looks of the AFC playoffs, it's going to be hard to block a championship matchup between the Chargers and Colts. The four teams set to play next weekend enter the playoffs with problems. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady lost his best target, Wes Welker. The Ravens have struggled at wide receiver and in the secondary. The Bengals' already-slow receiving corps must worry about Chad Ochocinco's sore knee, injured during warm-ups before Sunday night's 37-0 loss to the Jets. The Jets may be healthy, but they have to try to win two games in six days against the Bengals with a rookie quarterback, Mark Sanchez. Because next weekend's wild-card games figure to be physical contests in cold locations (Foxborough, Mass., and Bengals), the Chargers and Colts have a chance to rest while their divisional-round opponents get banged up. The pairings for the first round are perfect. The Jets travel to Bengals for a 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday matchup of the two lowest-scoring AFC playoff teams. The Ravens-Patriots game, scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday, features two top quarterbacks -- Tom Brady and Joe Flacco -- who really don't know what they have at wide receiver from week to week. Tom Brady's struggled to find a third receiver and get the ball to tight ends, while Joe Flacco has dependable Derrick Mason and plenty of questions. Overall, there was a 50 percent turnover in the AFC playoffs from last season, with the Bengals, Patriots and Jets replacing the Steelers, Dolphins and Titans. Philip Rivers and Peyton Manning will sit back for a week and wait to see who stands in the way of their third playoff meeting in three seasons. Here are 10 questions on the AFC playoffs: 1. What is the key theme for the AFC playoffs? Quarterbacks. Quarterbacks. Quarterbacks. Five elite quarterbacks dominate the AFC playoffs: Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Philip Rivers, Joe Flacco and Carson Palmer of the Bengals. Having this many elite quarterbacks could make for some great football. The only one of that group who hasn't won a playoff game is Carson Palmer, who had his left knee blown out in the first quarter of the Bengals' playoff loss to Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers after the 2005 season. Tom Brady is 14-3 in playoff games, Peyton Manning is 7-8, Philip Rivers is 3-3 and Joe Flacco is 2-1. The key matchups could start in the divisional round. Philip Rivers is 0-2 in playoff games against Tom Brady. Peyton Manning is 1-2 against Tom Brady but won their last playoff meeting -- the 2006 AFC Championship Game. Philip Rivers is 2-0 against Peyton Manning. 2. What are the key injuries heading into the playoffs? Wes Welker, the Patriots' go-to receiver, appeared to blow out his left knee on a non-contact play less than six minutes into Sunday's 34-27 loss to the Texans. That injury -- believed to be a torn ACL and MCL -- alone could cost Patriots a trip to the Super Bowl. Take away their easy neutral-site win over the Buccaneers in London, and the Patriots were 1-6 in road games and faded in the second half. Because they don't throw much to the tight end and don't have a fully developed number 3 wide receiver, Tom Brady is forced to rely on Wes Welker and Wes Welker alone if Randy Moss slows down in the second half of games. Wes Welker led the NFL with 123 catches for 1,348 yards and four touchdowns. According to ESPN Stats & Information, Tom Brady is a 68 percent passer this year with 8.3 yards per attempt when Wes Welker is in the game. Without him, he completes 58.3 percent of his passes with 5.9 yards per attempt. Guard Dan Connolly had to be taken to the Pats' locker room Sunday because of an ankle injury. Tom Brady himself is playing with three cracked ribs and a broken right ring finger. The Patriots rested defensive linemen Vince Wilfork (foot) and Ty Warren (ankle) on Sunday, so they should be healthy for the first playoff game. The Colts have the longest injury list with 12 players, but the bye week should allow defensive ends Dwight Freeney (abdomen) and Robert Mathis (quad), left tackle Charlie Johnson (foot), safety Melvin Bullitt (shoulder) and cornerback Jerraud Powers (knee) to start in their first playoff game. The Chargers are in good shape because they rested linebacker Shawne Merriman (foot), fullback Jacob Hester (shoulder) and wide receiver Vincent Jackson (Achilles) in Week 17. The only question is safety Eric Weddle, who has a knee injury. Backup defensive lineman Antonio Garay suffered a hamstring injury Sunday. The Ravens welcomed the return of safety Ed Reed on Sunday. Ed Reed had missed four games with a groin injury. Their only other concern is linebacker Tavares Gooden, who has been out with a groin injury. Safety Chris Crocker (ankle) was the Bengals' only real concern entering Sunday night, but they suffered some major blows against the Jets. Defensive tackle Pat Sims broke a forearm and is out for the playoffs, affecting an interior line that was already banged up. Safety Tom Nelson injured a knee and his status is uncertain. Ochocinco should be able to play despite a knee injury suffered in pregame warm-ups, but there are concerns about his explosiveness. The Jets are healthy, other than punter Steve Weatherford, who almost missed Sunday night's game because of a hamstring injury. 3. What styles of games are expected? Even though three of the league's top four defenses are represented in the AFC playoff field, the potential for high-scoring games exists because of the quarterbacks. The Ravens, Colts, Patriots and Chargers averaged between 24.4 and 28.4 points per game. That could put the Bengals and Jets at a disadvantage because the Bengals score only 19.1 points and the Jets 21.8. Scoring and big plays have been the ticket to success in the NFL this year. Entering Week 17, according to ESPN Stats & Information, the Patriots ranked second in average yards after the catch. The Colts were seventh, the Chargers ninth, the Ravens 16th and the Bengals 25th. The Pats, for example, average 5.46 yards after each catch, while the Bengals gain only 4.34 yards after receptions. Losing Wes Welker, though, will bring down the Patriots' YAC numbers. Still, that 1-yard gap for the Bengals compared to the better YAC teams could be the difference between first downs and fourth downs. It also may explain why the Bengals score a touchdown per game less than the Colts, Chargers and Patriots. 4. The AFC has become a haven for 3-4 defenses, so how will the 3-4 affect the playoffs? The Colts and Bengals are the only 4-3 teams; everyone else runs a 3-4. The trend this season has been to pass against 3-4 teams. Look what happened to the Ravens. Last year, they ran the ball 37 times a game to make it easier for Joe Flacco to be a playoff quarterback as a rookie. This year, coach John Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Cam Cameron joined a growing number teams that decided to pass more against 3-4 defenses. The reason is simple: A 3-4 defense with a good nose tackle is hard to run against, so it's easier to spread the field with three or four receivers, try to force the 3-4 into nickel or dime packages, and let the nose tackle stand on the sidelines. The Chargers aren't as strong against the run without former Pro Bowl nose tackle Jamal Williams, and they are currently down to the their fourth-string nose tackle, Ian Scott. It makes no sense to run at Ravens Pro Bowl nose tackle Haloti Ngata, so it's easier to pass than run against them. 5. Safeties were essential to advancing to the AFC title game last year. What's the story this year? The trend has shifted to the tight ends, who have a distinct advantage over the safeties in the AFC playoff field. Bob Sanders of the Colts is on injured reserve. Troy Polamalu of the Steelers didn't make the playoffs. Ed Reed missed four games because of a groin injury. That could mean big days for the tight ends. Pro Bowlers Cowboys Clark of the Colts (100 catches) and Antonio Gates of the Chargers (79 catches for 1,157 yards) will create matchup nightmares for defenses. Because of injuries at wide receiver, the Ravens have used tight end Todd Heap in wide receiver splits, hoping he draws a cornerback to create a mismatch. Todd Heap had his best season in years with 53 catches, 593 yards and six touchdowns. The Bengals and Patriots, however, won't be much of a problem. Only the Rams throw to the tight end less than the Patriots. The Bengals' J.P. Foschi and Daniel Coats have combined for only 43 catches. 6. Will running backs be a big factor? Maybe not. The top three teams aren't much of a threat running the ball. The Colts have two former first-rounders in Joseph Addai and Donald Brown, but both are averaging less than 4 yards a carry. LaDainian Tomlinson has 12 touchdowns and is tough near the goal line, but he's averaging only 3.3 yards a carry. The Patriots try to run the ball 30 times a game, and defenses have to guess who's going to get the carries. Laurence Maroney lost his starting job in Week 16 when he fumbled at the Jaguars' 1-yard line, his fourth lost fumble of the season. He was inactive in Week 17 even though he was healthy. Kevin Faulk (335 yards) and Sammy Morris (319) have been role players, and Fred Taylor is just getting back from ankle surgery and has only 269 yards. The Ravens' Ray Rice is the star among the AFC playoff running backs with 1,338 yards and a 5.3-yard average. The Bengals are dependent on big games from Cedric Benson. Ray Rice made the Pro Bowl. Cedric Benson was a second alternate. 7. Who has the coaching edge in the AFC playoffs? The Patriots' Bill Belichick is the most experienced and dangerous playoff coach in the AFC, but he's in a tough spot. Patriots's road to the Super Bowl has to go through either Chargers or Colts, and it's going to be tough without Wes Welker. Believe it or not, Norv Turner of the Chargers may have the second-biggest edge. He's 3-3 as a playoff coach for the Chargers and has a team that matches up well against the Colts because of its tall pass-catchers and disruptive 3-4 defense. The Ravens' John Harbaugh went 2-1 last year in the playoffs, losing to the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. Jim Caldell is making his first trip to the playoffs running the Colts after taking over for Tony Dungy. The Bengals' Marvin Lewis has had only the loss to the Steelers in 2005. But he's also coached as an assistant in big playoff games in Ravens. 8. If the game comes down to a big field goal, which kicker would you favor? Normally, you would say Adam Vinatieri of the Colts, but not this year. Adam Vinatieri hasn't been able to shake a season-long knee injury and it's very likely the Colts will use veteran Matt Stover and not Adam Vinatieri. Adam Vinatieri had only nine field goals this season while Stover made 9 of 11. Put your money on Nate Kaeding of the Chargers first and Stephen Gostkowski of the Patriots second. Nate Kaeding was 32-of-35 on field goals and kicked many in critical situations. He scored 146 points this year. Stephen Gostkowski scored 125 points and was 26-of-31 on field goals. The Ravens might have been a higher seed had they kept Stover, who wasn't re-signed after the 2008 season. Steven Hauschka was cut after going 9-for-13 on field goals and cost the Ravens two possible victories because of misses. Billy Cundiff was signed off the street and has been solid (12-for-17), but he gave the Ravens a scare by missing two field goals in Sunday's win over the Raiders. The Bengals have a dependable kicker in Shayne Graham, who was 23-of-28 on field goals this season. 9. Can a rookie quarterback be a factor in the playoffs? It's possible. Mark Sanchez becomes the third rookie quarterback in two years to make the playoffs. The Jets' Rex Matt Rex Ryan becomes the third first-year coach in two seasons to make the playoffs. Matt Rex Ryan came from the Ravens, who made it to the AFC title game last season with a rookie QB (Joe Flacco). Mark Sanchez might have a tougher time. He wasn't as accurate in his rookie year as Joe Flacco or Matt Rex Ryan were a year ago. What will help, though, is that the Bengals aren't a high-scoring team, so as long as Mark Sanchez doesn't throw interceptions, the Jets might have a chance. 10. What are the key rematches in the AFC playoffs? The Jets play the Bengals only six days after beating them on Sunday night. Having the short week shouldn't be a problem because both teams can use the same game plans. The Patriots beat the Ravens 27-21 in Week 4 in Foxborough, but Tom Brady won't have Wes Welker to help him out this time. The Pats lost to the Colts 35-34 on Nov. 15 in the infamous \"fourth-and-2\" game. The Colts beat the Ravens 17-15 in Week 11. The Chargers lost to the Ravens 31-26 in Week 2, but they beat the Bengals 27-20 in Week 15.

And he was. He was a truly deserving Super Bowl MVP. As usual, Aaron Rodgers made a few tremendous throws that few quarterbacks in memory could pull off. But outside of Greg Jennings -- who was once again spectacular -- Packers's wide receivers let Aaron Rodgers down. The Packers lost Donald Driver to injury, and this group dropped way too many passes on the big stage. Jordy Nelson posted a huge statistical day and beat one-on-one coverage consistently. But, like the rest of this wide receiving corps, Jordy Nelson just had too many dropped passes. James Jones also had a drop that very well could have gone for a long touchdown. Just imagine what Aaron Rodgers' night would have looked like with a little more help from his friends. Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger left a lot of plays on the field in this game. Turnovers killed the Steelers, but so did Ben Roethlisberger's accuracy problems. The first interception didn't look to be his fault; the second was. But the missed throws were at least as crucial. And the deep ball gave him the most trouble. Ben Roethlisberger orchestrated a great drive that was capped with a fantastic touch throw to Mike Wallace with 7:34 left in the game. But outside of that, Ben Roethlisberger didn't look like himself, and it cost his team.

Larry Fitzgerald also brought up Ravens backup quarterback Marc Bulger, whose contract is up this offseason. What's also notable about Cardinals asking Larry Fitzgerald for his opinion is that the Cardinals know they have to keep their wide receiver happy. Larry Fitzgerald is entering the last year of his contract and if the Cardinals don't have a viable quarterback, their Pro Bowl wide receiver might be less likely to re-sign.

The Patriots quarterback on Sunday became the first unanimous choice for The Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award since the AP began using a nationwide panel of media members who cover the league. He surpassed himself, too: In 2007, when Tom Brady won his first MVP, he got 49 votes; one voter went for Brett Favre. \"It is always flattering to be chosen for such a prestigious award,\" Tom Brady said. \"But I also look at it as a team award, as nothing in football gets accomplished without the mental toughness and determination of every player and coach associated with that team. \"I am very humbled to be a part of an organization where winning comes first, and our goals are based around the success of the team.\" Those successes, including three Super Bowl titles in the last 10 years, are in great part due to Tom Brady's excellence. Although he didn't set nearly as many passing marks as in'07, Tom Brady by far was the league's top performer in leading Patriots to a 14-2 record, best in the NFL. He had a record streak of 335 throws without being intercepted, and passed for 36 touchdowns with only four picks. Not that the 33-year-old Tom Brady would compare this season's Patriots to any others. \"Every team every year is different,\" he said, \"and over the course of 100 practices and many games a team establishes its identity. Players change, schemes change, opponents change, which is why the game is so exciting year in and year out. \"The fact that 32 teams start out each year with the same goal is why the popularity of the sport is at an all-time high. The great part about our sport is that nothing comes easy, and wherever you stand at the end of the year is the exact place that you deserve to be.\" Individually, Tom Brady stands above all others. The only Patriot to win the award, he and Peyton Manning, his rival for the NFL's best quarterback, have split the last four MVPs. Tom Brady followed his previous MVP trophy with a lost season, tearing left knee ligaments in the first half of the 2008 opener. His return in 2009 was solid, although hand and rib injuries slowed him. This year, even with a sore right foot that required postseason surgery, Tom Brady was simply dynamic. He twice threw for four touchdowns in a game and four times had three. Twelve times, he had a passer rating of at least 100. And he guided a young team in transition to 14 victories. \"Tom Brady is so special because he's such a great leader and all the players can relate to him,\" team owner Robert Kraft said. \"These kids [rookies] who come in live in awe of him, but the nice thing is he treats them well. \"He works very hard, he studies very hard,\" Kraft added. \"Being a great quarterback isn't just being very skilled. It's being able to process information quickly, to make the adjustments, and I think he's fabulous at that.\" As fabulous as he might have been, Tom Brady, not surprisingly, has some regrets about 2010. \"When the season is over, 31 teams are disappointed about the outcome,\" he said. \"There is only one champion, and nobody plays this game for second place. The desire and hunger is about winning, which to me never gets old. The motivation to get up and work every day for that goal is something that challenges us all. \"Our team has very high expectations, and our team will come back this year with the same purpose,\" he said. \"Whether or not that leads to a championship season will be determined by the commitment each player makes to do their job as best as they possibly can.\" The way Tom Brady does.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/news/story?id=6095673", "Entities": ["Tom Brady", "Patriots", "Brett Favre", "Peyton Manning"]}, {"title": "Charlie Peprah's road leads home", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Charlie Peprah came into a jubilant locker room in pain. But it was a good pain. The Packers' starting strong safety needed help taking off his shoulder pads, but he didn't mind. Charlie Peprah noted he barely had feeling in his hands. He told a small group of reporters that he might have to stop talking because he felt he might cramp up. It was OK, though, because Charlie Peprah is living the dream of playing in a Super Bowl in his hometown. After the Packers held off the Steelers 31-25 to win Super Bowl XLV on Sunday, Charlie Peprah and his teammates were smiling. But he also was reflective. \"It's a long journey, a long road,\" Charlie Peprah said. \"God is great. Man, it just makes everything that much sweeter.\" He was reminded of his mom, Elizabeth Charlie Peprah, who fled Ghana with her husband and a young child in tow after her father, Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, who was the head of state of Ghana, was executed in 1979 following a coup. They eventually wound up in the Cowboys area, and Charlie Peprah was born in Fort Worth. Charlie Peprah's parents divorced, leaving Elizabeth to raise the kids alone. So when you saw Charlie Peprah smiling inside the Packers' locker room Sunday night, you knew why he's happy. He's come through it. He played high school football at Plano East in suburban Cowboys, got a college scholarship to play at Alabama, then was a fifth-round draft choice of the Giants in 2006. But he was cut in training camp and signed on with the Packers. He was mainly a special teams player and couldn't get any run at safety on a regular basis. Then he signed an injury settlement in 2009 and went looking for work until the Falcons signed him toward the end of the season. He was released after that season and returned to the Packers this season, signing a one-year deal, hopeful he would get more playing time. But the Packers drafted Morgan Burnett to play safety, keeping Charlie Peprah on the bench. Charlie Peprah struggled with a left quad injury, but when Morgan Burnett was lost for the season with a knee injury, the team had no choice but to use Charlie Peprah. \"Charles has been a pro all season long,\" secondary coach Darren Perry said. \"The way he prepares and the way he takes care of business day in and day out [is important]. There's no surprise to me that he's having the success that he's had all season long.\" As the season progressed, Charlie Peprah got better and started 11 regular-season games. He capped it off with a game-high 10 tackles in Super Bowl XLV. It wasn't the best game in the world for Charlie Peprah, but he did enough along with Nick Collins to keep the secondary in shape, especially on the last drive of the game and with Charles Woodson out with a broken left collarbone. So excuse Charlie Peprah for going down memory lane when it comes to his feelings about the Super Bowl. Of the 15 tickets he got for the game, one was for his father, who came in from West Africa to watch his son play. \"Everything I've been through, getting cut twice, and to end up starting the Super Bowl and hopefully I can go get another one,\" he said. \"It's just special.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/columns/story?columnist=watkins_calvin&id=6097232", "Entities": ["Charlie Peprah", "Packers", "Steelers", "Cowboys", "Giants", "Falcons", "Morgan Burnett", "Nick Collins", "Charles Woodson"]}, {"title": "Aaron Rodgers tosses 3 TD passes as Packers drop Steelers to win Super Bowl XLV", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Aaron Rodgers at long last casts his own shadow. All it took was a Super Bowl victory for the Packers. Capping one of the greatest postseasons for any quarterback, Aaron Rodgers led the Pack to their first NFL championship in 14 years Sunday, 31-25 over the Steelers. They reclaimed the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named for their legendary coach who won the first two Super Bowls and is making his own star turn in New York in the play named after him. Aaron Rodgers, the game's MVP, thrilled his legion of Cheesehead fans with a spectacular six-game string that should finally erase the bitterness of the Brett Favre separation in Packers. After sitting for three long years before Brett Favre left in 2008, Aaron Rodgers is now equal with Brett Favre in Super Bowl wins, and he extended the Packers' record of NFL titles to 13, nine before the Super Bowl era. \"You can stop it now,\" veteran receiver Donald Driver said. \"Aaron's proved that he's one of the best, if not the best, quarterback in this game today.\" You could say it means this: Forget Lombardi on Broadway, Packers has the newest Super Bowl hit. The favored Packers managed to overcome key injuries, building a 21-3 lead, then hung on to become only the second number 6 seed to win the championship. Coincidentally, the 2005 Steelers were the other. \"Wow! It's a great day to be great, baby,\" said Greg Jennings, who caught two of Aaron Rodgers' three touchdown passes. Aaron Rodgers threw for 304 yards, including a 29-yard touchdown to Jordy Nelson, who had nine catches for 140 yards to make up for three big drops. Aaron Rodgers found Greg Jennings, normally his favorite target, for 21- and 8-yard scores. \"We've been a team that's overcome adversity all year,\" Greg Jennings said, who noted injuries to Charles Woodson and Donald Driver. \"Our head captain goes down, emotional in the locker room. Our number 1 receiver goes down, more emotions are going, flying in the locker room. But we find a way to bottle it up and exert it all out here on the field.\" Charles Woodson was in so much pain from a broken left collarbone that he could barely address the team at halftime in the locker room. Few teams have been as resourceful as these Packers, who couldn't wait to touch the trophy honoring their greatest coach -- and their title. Several of them kissed it as Cowboys great Roger Staubach, walked through a line of green and gold, and up to the massive stage on the 50-yard line with the silver prize that is headed back to the NFL's smallest city. \"That is where it belongs,\" linebacker A.J. Hawk said. \"As long as the Packers have lived, it's going to be great to bring that back.\" Aaron Rodgers took the Packers to two late-season victories just to make the playoffs as a wild card. Then he guided them to wins at Eagles, Falcons and archrival Bears before his biggest achievement -- against a Steelers team ranked second in defense. They barely survived a sensational rally by the Steelers, who still own the most Super Bowl rings -- six in eight tries. But Steelers failed to get its third championship in six years, despite several valiant efforts by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Ben Roethlisberger's season began with a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. It ended with Ben Roethlisberger standing on the sideline, his head down, hands on his hips, feeling something he never experienced: defeat in a Super Bowl. \"I feel like I let the city of Steelers down, the fans, my coaches and my teammates and it's not a good feeling,\" said Ben Roethlisberger, who later buried his head in a towel and wept. Not even a decidedly black-and-gold crowd, with Terrible Towels swirling throughout the $1.2 billion stadium, could make a difference for the mistake-prone Steelers, who had three turnovers to none for Packers. Their two biggest defensive stars -- Defensive Player of the Year safety Troy Polamalu and outside linebacker James Harrison -- were virtually invisible. The offense didn't seem to miss outstanding rookie center Maurkice Pouncey, who was out with an ankle injury, but Ben Roethlisberger only occasionally made key plays until the second half. The biggest plays were left to Aaron Rodgers, Nick Collins with a 37-yard interception return for a TD, Greg Jennings, Jordy Nelson, and the rest of the guys in green and gold. In the end, they gave coach Mike McCarthy his first Super Bowl victory against the team he rooted for while growing up in Steelers. Besides Lombardi, Mike Holmgren won a title in 1997 with Brett Favre. Mike McCarthy was so certain of victory he fitted the players for championship rings on Saturday night -- a move sure to go down in Super Bowl lore. \"That was just a vote of confidence for us,\" Charles Woodson said. \"Get fitted for your ring. I don't know when we'll get them, but it'll fit.\" Charles Woodson saw the Steelers, who rallied from a 21-7 halftime hole against Ravens three weeks ago, show the same resilience. A 37-yard catch and run by Antwaan Randle El -- an almost forgotten figure during his return season with just 22 receptions -- sparked a quick 77-yard drive. Hines Ward, the 2006 Super Bowl MVP, had 39 yards on three catches during the series, including an 8-yard TD when he completely fooled Jarrett Bush. A quick defensive stop and a 50-yard drive to Rashard Mendenhall's 8-yard touchdown run made it 21-17. But with coach Mike Tomlin's team driving for perhaps its first lead of the game, Rashard Mendenhall was stripped at the Packers 33 by Clay Matthews -- one of the few plays the All-Pro linebacker made. The Packers recovered, and Aaron Rodgers hit Greg Jennings for 8 yards and the winning points. Steelers's last score was on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace and a brilliant pitchout by Ben Roethlisberger to Randle El for a 2-point conversion, making it 28-25 with 7:34 left. Mason Crosby added a 23-yard field goal for the Packers and the Steelers had no more comebacks in them like the one Ben Roethlisberger staged to win the Super Bowl two years ago. He missed on his last three passes in the final moments. \"You play to be world champions,\" Clay Matthews said, \"and that's what we are today.\" The game capped an interesting weather week in Cowboys for the teams and fans alike. Snow and ice caused traffic snarls, canceled flights and caused injuries to six people when it fell from the roof of the stadium. Sunny skies and milder temperatures returned Sunday, but issues arose with seats at the game. A total of 1,250 temporary seats were considered unsafe hours before kickoff. Even while the teams were warming up on the field, workers were trying to fix the problems -- many involving seats carrying pricetags of $800 and up. About 400 people with tickets couldn't be seated inside the stadium and the league offered refunds of triple the ticket price. At least the Packers and Steelers put on a terrific show after Christina Aguilera botched the lyrics to the national anthem. Aaron Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson in stride with a long pass on Packers's first series, but the wideout let it slide through his hands. The Pack had discovered something, though, and went back to that play for the first touchdown. Jordy Nelson beat William Gay and held on for a 7-0 lead; the Packers have scored first in all five Super Bowl appearances. Just 24 seconds later, they were ahead by 14. Throwing from his end zone, Ben Roethlisberger's arm was hit by backup nose tackle Howard Green. The ball fluttered to the Steelers 37, where Nick Collins settled under it, then scooted down the right sideline and dived into the end zone for the 13th interception return for a score. Teams doing so are now 11-0 in Super Bowls. Needing to get busy or get buried, Steelers put together a 13-play drive to Shaun Suisham's 33-yard field goal. Then, after moving well again, Ben Roethlisberger's pass was stolen from Mike Wallace's hands by Bush at the Steelers 46. Aaron Rodgers coolly completed passes to Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson, James Starks ran for 12 yards as Troy Polamalu whiffed on a tackle, then Greg Jennings reached high and slightly behind to snag a 21-yarder over Troy Polamalu for a 21-3 edge. \"I had some opportunities to make some plays,\" Troy Polamalu said. \"I was just off a step here or there.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=310206009", "Entities": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Packers", "Steelers", "Brett Favre", "Donald Driver", "Greg Jennings", "Jordy Nelson", "Charles Woodson", "Cowboys", "A.J.

Aaron Rodgers is a Super Bowl championship quarterback in his own right. And he's the game's MVP, too. That's an honor Brett Favre, his Packers predecessor, never earned. With precise passes and cool under pressure, Aaron Rodgers completed 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions Sunday night to lead the Packers to a 31-25 victory over the Steelers for Packers's first NFL title since Brett Favre's in the January 1997 Super Bowl. Aaron Rodgers is 27 years old, just as Brett Favre was then. And after biding his time as a backup until the Packers split with Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers has quickly established himself as one of the game's best. This was his third full season as a starting QB, and he was particularly good throughout the playoffs, leading the number 6 seed Packers to three NFC road victories before winning the championship Sunday. \"I've never felt like there's been a monkey on my back. The organization stood behind me, believed in me,\" said Aaron Rodgers, general manager Ted Thompson's first-round draft choice six years ago. \"I told Ted back in 2005 he wouldn't be sorry with this pick. I told him in'08 that I was going to repay their trust and get us this opportunity.\" Sure did, then made the most of it by throwing two TD passes to Greg Jennings and one to Jordy Nelson. Don't forget, Aaron Rodgers' strong performance came against Steelers's defense, the one that limited opponents to a league-low 14.5 points per game this season, and the one that features NFL Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu and linebacker James Harrison. \"He is the reason they won,\" Steelers defensive lineman Brett Keisel said. Added Steelers coach Mike Tomlin: \"He showed his mettle and continued to stand in there and throw the football accurately.\" That's not all Aaron Rodgers did. He changed plays at the last moment, reading the defense before the snap and adjusting. He overcame a poor start, a couple of key drops and a third-quarter lapse. And he did it all without the benefit of any help from a Packers running game that was limited to 50 yards. \"We put everything on his shoulders,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"He did a lot at the line of scrimmage for us against a great defense.\" Aaron Rodgers was hardly perfect all game. But perhaps he could be forgiven if he was experiencing some jitters: After all, the guy only played in one playoff game in his career before this season. \"We kind of struggled at times on offense,\" Aaron Rodgers said. That's true. He began the game by overthrowing receivers and generally being off-kilter, completing only one of his first five passes. But he knows a thing or two about slow starts. Just look at Aaron Rodgers' career arc. Despite record-setting years during high school in Chico, Calif., the skinny Aaron Rodgers -- he was 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds back then -- was not seriously recruited by major college football programs. That was OK, though. He never let it bother him. Aaron Rodgers went to a community college. Then he starred for two seasons at California. Finally, he was on everyone's radar, although he wound up sliding to when Packers picked 24th overall in 2005. How good does that choice look now? Against Steelers, Packers's second drive began with Aaron Rodgers overthrowing Greg Jennings. And then? Aaron Rodgers couldn't miss. He went 5 for 5 for 63 yards, finishing the possession with a 29-yard toss to Jordy Nelson. \"It was actually a screen play, but he [changed] to a go route,\" said Jordy Nelson, who set a team record for yards receiving in a Super Bowl with 140. \"That's what we hit.\" And when they did, Aaron Rodgers simply raised both arms in the familiar \"Touchdown!\" signal, then briefly embraced guard Daryn Colledge. Aaron Rodgers is a generally laid-back guy, and he does not engage in any of that wild running around and helmet-slapping Brett Favre was so famous for when he was the player Cheeseheads loved the most. Late Sunday, it was clear who's got their hearts now: Packers fans filled Cowboys Stadium with choruses of \"Aa-ron Rodg-ers!\" and \"M-V-P!\" Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, with his two previous Super Bowl championships, was supposed to be the one who would relish the grand stage. But while he was throwing two first-half picks, it was Aaron Rodgers who shined. \"I didn't expect anything less from A-Rod,\" Packers defensive tackle B.J. Raji said. Aaron Rodgers zipped a 21-yard pass down the middle to Greg Jennings to put the Packers ahead 21-3. At that point, Aaron Rodgers was 11 for 16 for 137 yards and two TDs -- making him 10 for 11 in the stretch that followed his rough start. Early in the second half, though, Aaron Rodgers threw five consecutive incompletions. Drives were stalling. But Aaron Rodgers led a 55-yard touchdown drive after Steelers running back Rashard Mendenhall fumbled. On third-and-10, Aaron Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson on a 38-yard catch-and-run, with the receiver eluding would-be tacklers. That set up Packers at Steelers's 3, and on first down, Aaron Rodgers showed good judgment, holding onto the ball when he appeared to be looking to throw a jump-pass. Instead of forcing matters, Aaron Rodgers took the sack. On second-and-goal from the 8, Aaron Rodgers spun a spiral to Greg Jennings in the far corner of the end zone to put the Packers ahead 28-17. After Steelers pulled within three points, Aaron Rodgers led Packers right back down the field for a field goal. On one vital third down, he hit Greg Jennings for 31 yards down the seam. \"Outstanding throw,\" Greg Jennings said. Aaron Rodgers' work was done. After the Packers stopped the Steelers' last drive, all he had to was walk on the field and kneel down to run out the clock. A short while later, Aaron Rodgers was clutching the Vince Lombardi Trophy, having joined Brett Favre and Bart Starr as QBs who brought Super Bowl championships to the place they like to call Titletown USA.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6097144", "Entities": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Brett Favre", "Packers", "Steelers", "Greg Jennings", "Jordy Nelson", "Troy Polamalu", "James Harrison", "Brett Keisel", "Mike Tomlin", "Mike McCarthy", "Daryn Colledge", "Cowboys", "Ben Roethlisberger", "B.J. Raji", "Rashard Mendenhall"]}, {"title": "Big Ben's undeserved reputation", "author": "Bill Barnwell", "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "The case for Ben Roethlisberger as a big-game quarterback before Super Bowl XLV was very clear. The narrative is not that hard to follow, since it eventually boils down to his 10-2 playoff record and a pair of Super Bowl rings. His performance in wins over the Ravens and Jets this postseason merely added to his book of clutch wins. By leading a dramatic comeback over the Ravens and shutting up the Jets with a rushing touchdown in the second quarter and two key completions on Steelers's final drive, Ben Roethlisberger helped the Steelers reach Sunday's big game. After losing to the Packers, though, it's temporarily difficult to say that Ben Roethlisberger finds a way to win when the game's on the line. He was clearly outplayed by his opposite number, throwing two picks and failing to lead his two-minute offense to the Packers' side of the field late in the game. That's not enough to tarnish his reputation, though, is it? The truth is that it's not totally clear why Ben Roethlisberger deserves such a reputation in the first place. A closer look at his play in big games suggests that Ben Roethlisberger's actual performance isn't all that it's been purported to be. Truthfully, Ben Roethlisberger hasn't played very well in this year's playoffs. That incredible comeback against the Ravens came on the heels of a 17-point third quarter, in which the Steelers scored on three drives with 25 yards to go or less. (Their magic mysteriously vanished on the two drives that started inside their own territory during that quarter, which produced 26 yards and two punts.) He needed those two critical passes on the final drive against the Jets because his offense had totally shut down after producing 17 points in the first half, with an interception, a drive that produced 13 yards before a punt and a Ben Roethlisberger fumble that resulted in a safety. He finished the day 10-of-19 for 133 yards with two picks. No matter how you slice it, that's not a good performance. The other numbers don't look good under the light of day, either. One of those rings, of course, came during Ben Roethlisberger's ugly day in Super Bowl XL, in which he was 9-of-21 for 123 yards with two interceptions. That's not leading your team to a ring; it's being dragged by the other 52 guys toward one. Among his wins are another ugly performance against the Jets (17-of-30 for 181 yards with two picks) and an abbreviated showing against the Chargers (17-of-26 for 181 yards with a touchdown and a 25-yard pooch punt). There are two problems with the conventional wisdom here, and they're not new to readers of this column. One is that using win-loss records as a measure of player performance reduce them to \"good\" and \"bad\" games without any context. Would anyone say that Ben Roethlisberger's performance against the Seahawks was as good as his truly impressive performance against the Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII? Of course not. By solely saying Ben Roethlisberger produced two rings, though, we place equal value on his performances in those two games.

Mike McCarthy invited a representative from a ring company to the Packers' team meeting, asking the ring guy to take the measurements of every player on the team. Gentlemen, your fingers, please. The Rexy move worked, as the Packers capped a \"How'd they do that?\" season with a 31-25 victory over the Steelers on Sunday night at Cowboys Stadium. Even though they borrowed from the Jets, the Packers' championship saved the loudest message for the Giants -- a menacing message for Big Blue and every other team in the NFC: The Packers are here to stay. This isn't going to be a one-and-done season for the Packers, who are built for the long haul. With a terrific coach in Mike McCarthy, and with a 27-year-old, Super Bowl MVP quarterback in Aaron Rodgers, the Packers have the potential to break the flavor-of-the-year trend in the NFC. The Packers were the 10th different NFC team to reach the Super Bowl in the past 10 years, but that stops now. This is a talented, tough-minded team that has the right to dream of more Lombardi Trophies in the future. Finally free from the whims of Brett Favre, who held the organization hostage until 2008 with his annual retirements and unretirements, the Packers have what every franchise longs for -- stability at the quarterback position. Aaron Rodgers shredded a very good defense, passing for 304 yards and three touchdowns. When it got tense in the fourth quarter, with the pressure starting to affect the Packers, he made the throw of his life -- a 31-yard strike to Greg Jennings on a third-and-10. It led to a field goal and, more importantly, allowed the Packers to milk valuable time from the clock. \"This,\" Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward said of Aaron Rodgers, \"was a great coming-out party for him.\" Aaron Rodgers' effort culminated one of the greatest postseasons in history for a quarterback -- nine touchdown passes and 1,094 yards. As long as he's around, the Packers are going to be a power in the NFC -- and he's going to be around for a long time. \"It's a dream come true,\" Aaron Rodgers said. \"It's what I dreamt about as a little kid, watching Joe Montana and Steve Young -- and we just won the Super Bowl.\" The Giants have more to worry about than just Aaron Rodgers. The Packers finished the season with 15 players on injured reserve, including six starters. We're talking about key players such as running back Rex Ryan Grant, tight end Jermichael Finley and linebacker Nick Barnett. They won a championship without those cogs; imagine when the team is healthy. The Packers are young (average age: 26.2) and they're not going to get ripped apart anytime soon by free agency. Barring something unforeseen, they have the ability to -- dare we say it? -- stage a Lombardi-esque run. But this team has more than talent. It has attitude. It has toughness. The Packers lost cornerback Charles Woodson (broken collarbone) and wide receiver Donald Driver (ankle sprain) in the first half, and they refused to give in. They subscribe to the \"Next Man Up\" philosophy. \"That's the story of our season,\" Mike McCarthy said. At halftime, Charles Woodson, knowing he was done for the night, stood up in the locker room and made a tearful speech, imploring his teammates to finish the job. He had been chasing a Super Bowl ring for 13 seasons, and now he was asking -- pleading -- his teammates to carry him home. \"I shed a lot of tears,\" said Charles Woodson, cradling the Lombardi Trophy after the game with one arm. \"I haven't cried that much in a long time.... It doesn't matter now because I'm a champion.\" Charles Woodson's speech lasted only a few words, according to teammates, because he broke down. Didn't matter, the message was sent. The Packers turned to a seldom-used cornerback named Pat Lee, who was forced into a prominent role in the second half. Lee did the job, because it seems like everybody does the job for the Packers -- from GM Ted Thompson to Mike McCarthy to Aaron Rodgers to the last guy on the roster. Mike McCarthy has instilled that resilience in this team. It's a rare quality. Plenty of teams say they have it, but only a few really do. The Giants say they have it, and they talk about how much they believe in Tom Coughlin, but they squandered a once-promising season with a late fade. Their December collapse was punctuated with a loss in Packers, and that was no coincidence. They're going to be chasing the Packers for some time now. Packers has its first championship since a young Brett Favre won it with Reggie White in 1996, and the rings are coming. The measurements are done. \"I'm a size 17,\" said defensive tackle Howard Green, noting a busted knuckle. \"My ring is coming soon.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/columns/story?columnist=cimini_rich&id=6097476", "Entities": ["Mike McCarthy", "Rex Ryan", "Packers", "Steelers", "Cowboys", "Jets", "Giants", "Aaron Rodgers", "Brett Favre", "Greg Jennings", "Hines Ward", "Ryan Grant", "Jermichael Finley", "Nick Barnett", "Charles Woodson", "Donald Driver", "Tom Coughlin"]}, {"title": "Christina Aguilera repeats anthem lyrics", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Christina Aguilera says she flubbed a line as she belted out the national anthem at the start of the Super Bowl on Sunday night after getting lost in the moment and losing her place. \"I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of its anthem still came through,\" she said in a statement after the performance.

It made things real for us.\" According to center Scott Wells, the ploy fit Mike McCarthy's week-long theme. \"We're a confident bunch and we knew we had a tough challenge,\" Scott Wells said. \"But the message all week has been about us. It wasn't about them. We knew if we played our game well, we would win this game.\" Some players spent longer than others, imagining what it would be like to slip on the ring. \"It was the night before the game,\" linebacker Desmond Bishop said. \"And we could see that it was right there.

But a pair of commercials by automakers took the early trophy for online buzz. A two-minute ad for Chrysler starring Eminem and a Volkswagen ad featuring a mini-Darth Vader that went viral before it even aired were two of the most talked-about spots during advertising's big night, the Super Bowl, in which Packers defeated the Steelers, 31-25. Chrysler was one of nine automakers that took advantage of advertising's biggest and most expensive showcase, at $3 million for 30 seconds, to try to show they're back after two tough years for the industry. The cinematic third-quarter Chrysler ad starred Eminem driving through Lions and introduced a new car, the Chrysler 200 sedan, amid scenes of the city that shift from the gritty to the glamorous. A voiceover talks about how the city has survived going through \"hell and back.\" \"This is the Motor City and this is what we do,\" Eminem says. The Chrysler ad was \"the big story of the night,\" according to NM Incite, a Nielsen/McKinsey Co. that tracks online buzz. Consumers repeated the \"imported from Lions\" slogan over and over in online buzz, the company said. \"It was a very risky commercial, but it scored very well with our panel\" that rates the ads, said Tim Calkins, Clinical Professor of Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management. Another hit was Volkswagen's ad that showed a boy in a Darth Vader costume trying to use \"The Force\" on objects, including the Passat. \"It really wasn't selling a car, it was selling a feeling, and it tapped into its target market of families very effectively, which you usually don't see in a car ad,\" said Robert Kolt, an instructor at Michigan State University College of Communication Arts & Sciences. Volkswagen released the ad early on Youtube.com and it had more than 13 million views before the game started. Elsewhere, celebrities and humor dominated. A scantily clad Kim Kardashian broke up with her trainer for Skechers, Roseanne Barr took a big hit from a log in a Snickers ad and comedian Joan Rivers, her head at least, became a GoDaddy girl. According to the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter, the best-scoring ads featured dogs: A Doritos ad that showed a man taunting a tiny pug and getting smashed under a glass door, and a Bud Light ad that showed dogs catering a party. The newspaper uses a panel of viewers who rate the commercials as they watch them. J.R. Burningham won $1 million Sunday for directing the \"Pug Attack\" Doritos ad, which topped the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter. The ad was one of thousands entered in the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl ad contest. After avoiding the Super Bowl for two years as it went in and out of a government-led bankruptcy, General Motors came back with five ads for Chevrolet. In one ad, a seemingly mundane car dealership ad is disrupted when a Camaro suddenly morphs into the Bumblebee character from the \"Transformers\" movies. One miss was daily coupon website Groupon's fake public service ad with Timothy Hutton, which appeared to be a plea for help for people of Tibet but instead touted a deal from Groupon for fish curry. While aiming for humor, \"It wasn't a very effective piece of communication and clearly rubbed some people the wrong way\" for making light of sensitive topics, Calkins said. A Homeaway.com ad featuring a \"test baby\" smashed against a window also garnered negative reaction from ad experts and \"didn't resonate with people,\" Calkins said. Some ads, predictably, drew criticism for being entertaining without doing much to sell people on the item being advertised. Among those was an ad for Lipton Brisk Iced Tea in which an animated Eminem explains why he doesn't usually do endorsements. He throws a business type off a roof when he refuses to rename the drink \"Eminem.\" \"It was confusing, and it didn't say a lot about the product,\" Calkins said. Not all ads went for laughs. Motorola Mobility's 60-second spot during the second quarter played off of the famous Apple ad \"1984.\" The dialogue-free Motorola ad shows a world where drones dress all in white and wear Apple iPod-like earbuds and a man uses a Motorola Xoom tablet to free and woo a girl. The message is that Apple has become an oppressor rather than a liberator. The ad shows Motorola's tablet as a worthy opponent to Apple's popular iPad, said Bill Ogle, chief marketing officer of Motorola Mobility. \"A lot of people just try to go for laughs,\" he said. \"There are all kinds of sex and monkeys and horses [during the Super Bowl], but what we were trying to do is a bit more of a serious story.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6098567", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Lions"]}, {"title": "Roger Goodell: Latest talks 'beneficial'", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "DALLAS -- Quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Drew Brees were among the star players who attended a negotiating session between the NFL and players' union Saturday, league sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen. While it is not unusual for players to occasionally sit in on negotiations, the presence of Peyton Manning was a surprise and is an early indication that the union is successfully getting the support of its superstar quarterbacks. During the 1987 players strike and subsequent labor strife, several of the league's star passers broke union ranks by signing licensing rights with the NFL which weakened the union revenue pool. Peyton Manning was also joined at Saturday's meeting by Drew Brees, who has been an activist as the team's player representative. Sources did not reveal if any players spoke during the negotiating session but their presence was considered symbolic, at the very least. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who was named the NFL's MVP on Sunday for the 2010 season, also has been an outspoken pro-union player rep. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the two-hour meeting with the players' union was \"beneficial.\" \"It's always a positive when both parties are talking,\" Goodell said. \"My focus is on the next three or four weeks,\" Goodell said. \"I've often said, our agreement expires on March 4th. We have to use that period of time to reach an agreement that's fair for the players, fair for the clubs, and allows our great game to grow for our fans.\" In an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" that aired the morning of the Super Bowl, Goodell called drug testing a key issue in labor talks. Goodell also addressed the NFL's labor issues on Sunday in an appearance on ESPN Radio's \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\". The two-hour meeting did not delve deeply into the issues that have created a fairly wide gulf that could lead to a lockout on March 4 when the current CBA expires. However, sources on both sides felt the meetings had some positive production as the owners and players scheduled at least two sessions this week and made progress on a working agenda. In addition to Goodell and his lead labor negotiators, sources said there were five owners present -- Jerry Richardson of the Panthers, Robert Kraft of the Patriots, Clark Hunt of the Chiefs, John Mara of the Giants and Dean Spanos of the Chargers. Richardson, who is co-chairman of the owners negotiating committee, continues to be perceived as the least flexible and most pessimistic spokesman for the owners, sources have noted on both sides. In an interview with ESPN Radio's \"Mike and Mike in the Morning, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said it was a \"good meeting\" but said \"I don't think anyone went into the meeting with the idea that we were going to build Rome in one day.\" Smith said the sides have been talking continually and it's probably better that those talks aren't publicized. Outlining major sticking points, Goodell talked about revenue division, rookie salaries and benefits for retired players. He added: \"We want to continue on with the integrity of the game, which is my number 1 issue\" and spoke of \"making sure we have the best drug program in sports.\" Both Goodell and Smith said that expanding the NFL season to 18 games wouldn't be a deal breaker either way. But Smith said that the NFL must address post-career health care if the league does add two games each season. Currently, Smith said, only players who play three seasons in the NFL are eligible for post-career health care and adding two games to a season will likely shorten NFL careers. Smith said the key issue is the money the owners want the players to give back in a new deal. \"At the economic height of this game, the owners want the players to give a billion dollars back. The only thing we ask is why and to demonstrate that,\" Smith said.

Two hours before the game, workers were frantically trying to fix the sections or get the fans \"relocated to similar or better seats,\" valued at $800. The NFL found alternate seating for 850 of the 1,250 fans affected. The 400 who were not able to be seated were given a refund of triple face value -- $2,400. \"Incomplete installation of temporary seats in a limited number of sections made the seats unusable,\" the NFL said in a statement. \"The safety of fans attending the Super Bowl was paramount in making the decision and the NFL, Cowboys and City of Arlington officials are in agreement with the resolution. We regret the situation and inconvenience that it may have caused. We will conduct a full review of this matter.\" The NFL tried to placate those 400 fans, taking them inside the stadium to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench. They also had the option of viewing the game from standing-room platforms in each corner of the stadium. Those fans will still get the triple refund. The fans \"watched game in club w/free food, soft drinks + merchandise,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello tweeted. \"The other 850 were re-located to seats in equal or better locations. NFL + Cowboys staff and families gave up seats.\" After saying all week that he expected Sunday's game to set an all-time Super Bowl attendance record with 105,000 fans seated inside the stadium, Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones come up short as the announced attendance of 103,219 was just shy of the 103,985 mark set in Super Bowl XIV between the Los Angeles Rams and Steelers at the Rose Bowl. Based on the 850 seats that were forfeited by the NFL and Cowboys to make room for those who were relocated, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed that the seating debacle was the reason the attendance record was not set. \"Yes,\" McCarthy said when asked if those seats would've been otherwise occupied had the displaced fans not been moved there. \"But we've been focused on the safety and experience of our fans.\" Instead, Jones will have to settle for the fourth-largest Super Bowl crowd. At about 4 p.m. in a concourse, a Steelers fan in a Troy Polamalu jersey was yelling obscenities into his cell phone at a stadium employee. He couldn't be seated because his seats were in an area near the seats that didn't meet code. \"We spent $3,000 on tickets,\" his friend said. \"After parking and $10 beers, it's $3,000. I just want to sit.\" Said Jennifer Dunfee, a friend in their party who flew in from Colorado for the game: \"We've spent over an hour trying to figure out how to get up there. The NFL closed four of the 10 entrance points into the stadium Sunday because of lingering ice on the roof of the stadium. On Friday, six people were injured by ice falling onto the sidewalk outside of the structure. NFL officials worked with the Arlington Fire Department to direct fans safely into the stadium. Safe corridors were established around any potential fall zones. In addition, the Arlington Police Department requested additional officers to the East Plaza ticket offices after the crowd started to become unruly after ticket scanners weren't functioning. There were chants of \"Jerry Sucks!\" and \"NFL Sucks!\" Steve and Dawn Novak traveled from Rochester, N.Y., to find that their $800 seats could be exchanged for three times face value, or else for a $350 standing-room-only ticket. They said the NFL would not reimburse the difference in value. They decided to take a loss on the ticket but attend the game after coming all that way. She is a Packers fan and he is a Steelers fan, and they were both angry about the experience. \"We said one of us was going to be happy at the end of the day and we were wrong,\" Steve Novak said. Cowboys resident Brian Shake said it generally takes 15 minutes to wait at the gate. He said he waited in line for an hour and 20 minutes on Sunday. \"It was just so long,\" Shake said. \"Problem was, you didn't know if you were in the right line or not. Everywhere you looked, there were just fences and screens and you couldn't get in anywhere.\" His wife Kathy Shake called it \"frustrating.\" \"It was very confusing on how to get in as you snaked your way through security.\" Paul Bryant, from Milwaukee, said he and his party waited at least 90 minutes in line to get into the stadium. \"Nobody knew where to go.... They had 14 detectives, and there's got to be 20,000 people going through here. If you do the math, that isn't enough,\" Bryant said. Stadium workers were covering the top corner sections of the upper deck behind one end zone two hours prior to kickoff. There were off-limits seats in the same upper-deck rows as seats that were deemed safe. Yellow police tape was used as a dividing line, with uniformed personnel also keeping folks away. The fans affected were directed to the Party Plaza area, which is located outside the stadium for the Super Bowl. The temporary-seating sections were erected in what is usually an open area. Fans can purchase $29 \"Party Passes\" to stand in the open areas during Cowboys games. Tim MacMahon covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was hoping for some good news in the form of a Super Bowl attendance record Sunday night, but he'll have to settle for fourth place. A total of 103,219 crammed into Cowboys Stadium to watch the Steelers and Packers, missing the record by 766. The construction of some temporary seating was not completed in time for the game, resulting in the relocation of 850 fans and refunds for 400 who could not be reseated in the stadium. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed the seats lost just hours before the game were the reason the record wasn't set. Sunday's total is the fourth largest for a Super Bowl and second largest for an NFL game in Cowboys Stadium, which opened in 2009. The attendance included 91,060 fans -- including 3,000 who bought tickets to watch the game on HD screens outside the stadium -- and 12,159 credentialed personnel (league and team officials and media). The previous record of 103,985 came at Super Bowl XIV between the Steelers and Los Angeles Rams on Jan. 20, 1980, at the Rose Bowl. The largest crowd for any NFL game was when the Cowboys played the Texans Oilers in front of 112,376 fans in a preseason game in 1994 at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Jones was hopeful his $1.2 billion jewel of a stadium would set the all-time attendance record.

The folks in the Packers jerseys seemed to be clustered at one end, quite a few tables away from people wearing Steelers jerseys, most of them seated a safe distance away in what amounted to a neutral corner. The room -- purported to be the largest in the White House, the East Room, the one with the Gilbert Stuart-painted portrait of George Redskins that was saved from the 1814 fire -- was filled with people and, yes, cheering. Super Bowl Sunday has surpassed New Year's Eve as the number 1 at-home party day of the year in America, and is now the second-fattest day on the calendar, trailing only Thanksgiving. Tens of thousands (at least) of Super Bowl parties were thrown across the nation this year, but it's hard for me to imagine a cooler Super Bowl party than this one, if for no other reason than it was the only one in the country hosted by the president of the United States and the first lady. (It's the only one that had the stunning Jennifer Lopez in attendance, too, but that's another story.) If you're looking for that TMZ moment, a revelation of Charlie Sheen getting drunk and turning the East Room into a piano bar or Tareq and Michaele Salahi slipping past security and sitting next to President and Mrs. Obama, stop reading right now. There wasn't even a confrontation between the Steelers and Packers fans, nothing salacious or awkward or anything worthy of YouTube. And if the conservative talking heads don't believe that when they take exception to whatever they think went on, as they inevitably will, tough spit. It was a Super Bowl party with nothing untoward to report, with probably a couple of hundred guests eating and drinking and looking at HD flat screens spaced the length of the room. In an interview with Bill O'Reilly that aired earlier in the day, President Obama made clear that he'd be the host with the most until the game got serious, and then he was going to get locked into the proceedings. And the president pretty much kept his promise. A half-hour before the game, he and Mrs. Obama received their guests in the Blue Room, the oval-shaped state room often used for receiving lines. Then, as is appropriate for any gathering of that many people for the occasion of watching a sporting event, we walked with great purpose to the buffet. (I promised Michelle Beadle I would tell her about the menu, so here goes: no guacamole that I saw, but perhaps the best cheeseburgers I've had in five years. Not that there weren't salads and all the healthy green stuff you'd expect would be served in the White House, but let me repeat: perhaps the best cheeseburgers I've had in five years. Isn't that mandatory fare for a Super Bowl party, cheeseburgers? Oh yes, and chicken wings.) Anyway, for those of us who have lived in greater Redskins, D.C., for a while, a traditional local obsession is finding out who attended what White House functions. The Redskins Post, my employer for 30 years, would publish the guest lists for state dinners, and I've seen people nearly come to tears because so-and-so was invited and they weren't, a Redskins peculiarity with which I've never come to terms. It was a complete non-secret around town that the beautiful and talented Jennifer Lopez and the beautiful and talented Marc Anthony were going to be in attendance and -- again, sorry for those trolling for gossip -- they couldn't have been friendlier and more engaging. Anthony, like a good many people in the room (starting with the party's host), is well-versed in sports, period, any and all of them. He could hold his own in any barber-shop conversation. But it wasn't a Hollywood room. There were members of the current administration in attendance, and a great many of the people, present company included, are Bearsans, South Side most of them. So it should come as no surprise that much of the conversation at a number of tables was Bears-centric. Jay Cutler: Was he really hurt in the game against the Packers, or maybe not so much? Was it permissible for Bearsans, given how much we hate the Cheeseheads, to root for the Packers to beat the Steelers? And with football officially ending, could we just fast-forward to Derrick Rose and how much we love him and pretty much everything about him? The President and First Lady, especially during breaks in the game, were like a bride and groom at their wedding reception, slipping easily from table to table to greet their guests, something they surely do a couple of hundred times a year. The Cheeseheads and the folks waving the Terrible Towels couldn't possibly have detected any bias or presidential rooting interest. President Obama, remember, appointed Steelers owner Dan Rooney, a Republican turned key supporter, as U.S. ambassador to Ireland. On the other hand, one of the party guests who introduced himself to me was Jim Doyle, the former governor of Wisconsin. With his beloved Bears eliminated, the president had no need to declare any feelings. A whole lot of folks who began the evening in neutrality ended it rooting for one side or another, or at least for a close game. But you couldn't read anything in the president's actions. The best thing for any party is a close game featuring a comeback. A couple of turnovers and one last potential game-winning drive just make it tense and loud, even in the White House. I'd never been to a Super Bowl party of any kind in my life. I covered 19 consecutive Super Bowls for The Redskins Post from 1987 through 2006, meaning I attended each and every game. That ended in 2007, when I began working the NBA pregame shows on ABC every Sunday in the winter/spring, duties that gave me just enough time to scramble to my hotel room and watch the big game in my preferred way, which is to say in total solitude. Even when I was a kid, I wanted to watch the game and hear the broadcast in its entirety, not socialize with kids in the dorm or family members or neighbors who had varying degrees of interest in the actual game. So no Super Bowl parties, none, ever until Sunday. I met Barack Obama years ago, first in Bears at a reception and then with Charles Barkley when I was helping organize and edit Barkley's second book, \"Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?\" Obama was about to run for the U.S. Senate and he was extraordinarily generous with us, granting Barkley and me time to talk, mostly about race and politics. We talked about sports as much as anything that day, about sports and education, sports and labor, sports and civic passions. And over the years, the senator and then the president made time to talk with me about sporting issues of all kinds, including how a guy from the South Side (me) could chose the Cubs over the White Sox. Turns out that's one of the few places the president and I have a fundamental disagreement. Obama is hardly the first U.S. president with a sweet tooth for sports. We're at five straight: Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama. But Obama's capacity for, passion for and range of knowledge is greater than any of the others. His ability to tie the issues of the day as they relate to sports to other cultural happenings is fascinating. When one of the president's lieutenants called last week to invite me (and my \"PTI\" co-host Tony Kornheiser) to attend the Super Bowl party, there was precious little time spent figuring out how to change my Sunday around. That phone call doesn't come every day, maybe not a second time ever. That it came from a president who calls the same plot of land where I grew up home, whose wife grew up in an adjacent neighborhood at exactly the same time, whose friends in a great many cases are my friends, made it even more desirable. And if I heard very little of the Packers-Steelers broadcast and paid less attention to the details of Sunday's game than I've liked to in years past well, that's exactly why God created TiVo.

Turns out even the $1.2 billion stadium could not deliver as much as hoped. What did deliver was the game. The Packers beat the Steelers 31-25, to bring the Lombardi trophy back home and help wipe away some of the stain from earlier Sunday. Before a speck of dirt was moved for a new stadium in Arlington in 2006, Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner and general manager, had his eyes on the Super Bowl attendance record. The NFL was pumping up the possibility, too. With 103,219 in attendance, Super Bowl XLV came up 766 short of the record. What in the name of Christina Aguilera messing up the lyrics of the national anthem happened? So Super Bowl XIV still has the record with a crowd of 103,985 seeing Steelers beat the Los Angeles Rams at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 21, 1980. It wasn't even the biggest football crowd in Cowboys Stadium history. That was the 105,121 who saw the Cowboys lose to the Giants in the 2009 regular-season opener. And it did not sniff the NBA All-Star Game, which drew 108,713 last year at Cowboys Stadium. The official breakdown: 91,060 fans in the stadium and the outdoor plaza area and 12,159 credentialed workers. More people packed Cowboys Stadium on Sunday than the population of Packers, Wis., but that was just a tease. Sort of like Super Bowl XLV week. Some of the issues that cropped up could not be avoided because of the weather, but to hear NFL commissioner Roger Goodell laud the efforts of the cleanup Friday seemed a tad disingenuous considering how bad the roads were for most of the week. The best decision the NFL made Sunday was to keep four of the stadium's 10 gates closed to avoid the repeat of Friday's incident, when six people were injured by ice and snow falling off the roof. As a result, however, getting into the stadium was harder than it should have been. Fans complained of long lines and little information. Those kinds of complaints you can live with, especially when so many in attendance have never been to Cowboys Stadium before. But how in the world could the doors to the stadium be open before the installation of 1,250 temporary seats was complete? How could the seats not meet code requirements on the day of the game? During a media tour of Cowboys Stadium in late January, NFL director of event operations Bill McConnell said the league would be working on the seating right up until kickoff. It sounded comical at the time, but he was telling the truth. And it wasn't so funny when the contractor, Seating Solutions, could not complete the seats on time. Six sections totaling 1,250 seats were closed off, leaving some fans in different locations or displaced altogether. The NFL attempted to adjust on the fly as best it could by moving the 400 fans from Sections 425A and 430A, which were in the upper reaches of the temporary seats in the west end zone, to a field club area behind the Steelers bench to watch the game on televisions and standing-room platforms. Those fans did not buy tickets to see the game on television. The league will offer $2,400, tripling face value, to those affected. Well, what if those fans paid more than face value? What about their flights to the area, which were probably delayed because of the weather? What about the price gouging at the hotels? With the second-largest crowd to see a Super Bowl gathered in Arlington, Texas, 400 affected fans might not seem like much of a big deal, but the NFL prides itself on public relations. This was just the culmination of a disappointing week for North Texas. Roger Staubach, chairman of the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Host Committee, said Super Bowl XLV will be determined a success if the NFL decides to bring its championship back here. A return never seemed like an \"if\" proposition before. After Sunday, maybe it's not such a sure thing anymore.

Schools dismissed early and people took time off work to watch the team's motorcade travel from Austin Straubel International Airport to Lambeau Field along a route that included Lombardi Avenue, named in honor of the legendary Packers coach Vince Lombardi. Fans who spent Sunday night partying picked up right where they left off Monday morning, showing up hours early for the parade. They jammed Lambeau's atrium and clogged the stadium's pro shop as they bought piles of Super Bowl gear and memorabilia. To make room, the team finally had to herd shoppers and visitors into a line that stretched outside the stadium. Ashley Ellis, 17, and Erica Christensen, 18, of Oak Creek, went to bed at midnight after celebrating the victory. They were up at 4 a.m. to drive to Packers and stake out a spot for the parade. They said the Packers gave them \"anxiety attacks\" as the Steelers made their second-half comeback, but on Monday all was right with the world in Packers. Asked why anyone would get up at 4 a.m. to visit a football stadium, Christensen replied simply. \"Love them,\" she said. By early afternoon throngs of fans in cheeseheads, green and gold beads, jerseys and Packer parkas jammed the team's route, transforming the streets into human trenches. A house across the street from the stadium -- Lambeau Field famously sits in the middle of a residential neighborhood -- blared Queen's \"We Are The Champions.\" Fans broke out in spontaneous chants of \"Go Pack Go!\" and \"The Bears Still Suck!,\" and mugged for television news crews. The crowd's cheers rose to a roar as the team's buses neared the stadium. News helicopters buzzed overhead. Players and other team officials could be seen holding up video cameras from their seats, recording the moment. Craig Umentum, 29, of Packers, dragged a green-and-gold wagon loaded with a case of beer to the stadium. \"The title is home, baby!\" Umentum yelled, his voice still hoarse from screaming during Sunday night's game. \"Whoo! Where it belongs! Packers, baby!\" Joni Hamalainen, 25, of Helsinki, Finland, arrived in Packers on Friday to watch the game. A longtime Packers fan, he said he considered going to the Super Bowl but it was too expensive. Instead he journeyed to Packers -- alone -- and watched the game with hundreds of new friends at the Stadium View Bar and Grill. \"It's a dream trip,\" he said as he waited for the motorcade to arrive. Rich Winker, 42, of La Crosse, showed up in former Packers linebacker Ray Nitchske's number 66 jersey and a replica old-school Packers leather football helmet. He said he decided at 11 p.m. Sunday to make the four-hour drive to Packers on Monday. \"It is awesome,\" he said. \"It's just unreal how many people are here. Who knows when it will happen again?\" The arrival was over quickly, though; the players didn't make any formal public appearances on Monday. The real party is set for Tuesday afternoon, when the Packers are expected to stage a public rally at Lambeau. Gov. Scott Walker, who proclaimed February as Packers Super Bowl championship month, was expected to attend. But there's a little hitch -- Lambeau's bleachers are covered with snow and ice. The team announced Monday morning that it would pay people $8 an hour to remove it ahead of the celebration. Adam Shirek, 23, of Milladore, drove two hours Monday to Lambeau for the parade. He said he's an unemployed college student with nothing better to do. He saw the line of snow volunteers at the stadium and decided to join them. Decked out in Clay Matthews' number 52 jersey, he attacked the ice with a fury. \"Could be a once-in-a-lifetime experience helping shovel snow at Lambeau Field... after the Super Bowl,\" he said as he worked. \"It will be memorable. Hopefully it'll bring me up on the season ticket waiting list.\" Justin Spes, 31, of Packers, took it all in as he sipped a beer from Umentum's wagon. He remembers the Packers' 1997 Super Bowl win, but said this time was so much sweeter. The 1997 team, led by quarterback Brett Favre and defensive end Reggie White, dominated opponents. This version of the Packers scrapped and clawed for everything it got. It was no different in the Super Bowl as the Packers barely survived a late Steelers rally, he said. \"We won that game,\" he said, \"purely on heart.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6099238", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Bears", "Clay Matthews", "Brett Favre"]}, {"title": "Richard Dent ponders HOF induction", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "It's between Dent's daughter Mary, who took the phone call and broke the news to her father that he made it after missing six times, and Dent's college coach Joe Gilliam Sr. Gilliam was the Titans State head coach from 1989-92 after serving as defensive coordinator. \"[Gilliam] coached at Titans State for many years and sent about 155 guys to the NFL,\" Dent said on \"The Afternoon Saloon\" on ESPN 1000. \"This is [Titans State's] 100th year of existence, and for me to be their first Hall of Famer... \"So many people came through that institution over the years and paved ways and made things available for a guy like myself and many others, I take that very seriously.\" After the radio interview, Dent said his daughter also is interested in presenting her father into the Hall.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6099644", "Entities": ["Titans"]}, {"title": "Bad day at the Steelers' office", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "They made it close maybe a little too close for Roger Goodell's comfort, at least as far as that trophy ceremony goes.

He's leaving that awkward coach-to-quarterback talk for another time. Gruden was in town Monday to start teaching his philosophy to the rest of the coaching staff. He's implementing a far different offense -- totally new terminology -- on a team unsure about its franchise player. Carson Palmer asked for a trade following a 4-12 finish that left the Bengals with only two winning records in the last 20 years. Owner Mike Brown refused, creating the possibility of friction at the most important position while the team changes offenses. Gruden, hired four days earlier, said he won't contact Carson Palmer until Brown and coach Marvin Lewis get the situation resolved. \"Things were said before I got here, and I think they've got to take care of those things in-house first,\" Gruden said. \"Then if they need me, I'll be glad to talk to him and do what I need to do to try to get him back. But I think that's got to come from upstairs, that's got to come from the head coach.\" The 31-year-old quarterback made his surprising trade request after the Bengals finished another dreadful season and Marvin Lewis agreed to return as head coach even though Brown promised no significant change in how the organization operates. Longtime offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski was fired a few weeks later, the only change so far. The rest of the staff is intact. Gruden is basing his offense on the assumption he'll have Carson Palmer running it. \"Until I hear something different, we're going to go forward with him as our quarterback,\" Gruden said. \"That's the only approach I can take right now. Whether it's right or wrong, I do not know. But that's the way I'm going about things.\" There's a lot of uncertainty as the offense starts its transition. Top receiver Terrell Owens is a free agent unlikely to return. Receiver Chad Ochocinco has a year left on his contract but is at odds with Marvin Lewis. Running back Cedric Benson also is a free agent, turned off by the team's decision to throw more last season. With uncertainty over the collective bargaining agreement, Gruden isn't sure how much time he'll have to teach the new system to whoever is on the roster. The 43-year-old coach has spent most of his career in the Arena Football League and the United Football League. He won four league titles as a quarterback and two as a head coach in the Arena league. He was an assistant to older brother Jon Gruden in Buccaneers from 2002-08. Last year, he was the head coach and general manager of the Florida Tuskers of the UFL. The Tuskers ceased operation on Jan. 12, and Gruden was moving to head coach of the UFL's new Virginia franchise when the Bengals showed an interest. \"It came when I didn't really expect it,\" Gruden said. \"I never really have actively pursued an NFL job -- not because I didn't want to get in the NFL, but because I was happy where I was.\" Marvin Lewis decided the Bengals should evolve into a run-first offense in 2009, and they won the AFC North. They tried to become more diverse last season, bringing in Terrell Owens and throwing more often. They never made it mesh, losing 10 games in a row. Gruden hasn't received any overriding direction from Marvin Lewis on how to run the offense. \"He's the head coach, so whatever vision he has is my vision,\" Gruden said. \"If he has a vision of running the ball 30 times, then that's going to be the vision. We'll do the best we can to appease him. But there's been no vision that's been told to me right now. It's just come on in here, install your offense and let's make a change.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6099414", "Entities": ["Bengals", "Carson Palmer", "Marvin Lewis", "Terrell Owens", "Cedric Benson", "Buccaneers"]}, {"title": "111 million tuned in to Super Bowl XLV", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "NEW YORK -- For the second year in a row, the Super Bowl has set a record for American television viewing. The Nielsen Co. said Monday that an estimated 111 million people watched the Packers outlast the Steelers in professional football's ultimate game. That tops the 106.5 million who watched the 2010 game between Saints and Colts. The series finale of \"M-A-S-H\" had held the title of the most-watched TV show in the United States for 27 years. It is now number 3. Fox had the advantage of a game between two of the National Football League's iconic franchises and, even though it looked like it could be a rout when the Packers took a 21-3 lead, it went down to the final minute and held viewers' interest. In fact, the most-watched single play of the game was Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's final incomplete pass to Mike Wallace with about a minute to go, according to measurements by TiVo Inc., the digital video recorder maker. When that pass hit the ground, it clinched the game for Packers. The five most-watched events in U.S. TV history are now \"M-A-S-H\" (seen by just under 106 million people on Feb. 28, 1983) and the last four Super Bowls, Nielsen said. Television ratings in general have been super for the NFL this year, with viewership up 13 percent over last year, Nielsen said. Games on CBS, Fox and NBC averaged 20 million viewers, more than twice what networks get for their prime-time programming. \"Super Bowl XLV caps what is arguably the most successful season that any sports league has ever had,\" said Pat McDonough, senior vice president for insight and analysis at the Nielsen Co. \"The number of people watching NFL games has never been higher, with 24 percent more people watching the average NFL game this year than just five years ago. The Super Bowl continues to be in a category of its own.\" Football has become the communal event that television, in a splintered competitive world of dozens of networks, rarely provides outside of \"American Idol\" or the Oscars. Compelling story lines for the games and the growth in high-definition television help make the games compelling for viewers. The games also tend to be DVR-proof, with viewers wanting to see them live. Traditions that have built around the game itself make the Super Bowl compelling to non-sports fans. Christina Aguilera's goof on the National Anthem, the Black Eyed Peas halftime show and the dozens of commercials that companies debut on TV's biggest stage were water-cooler discussion topics along with the game on Monday. Fox's \"Glee\" took advantage of the time slot directly after the game, reaching 26.8 million viewers for its special episode. It was the most-watched scripted entertainment program on TV since Fox's \"House\" aired after the Super Bowl three years ago, Nielsen said. TiVo also judged the Snickers commercial featuring Richard Lewis and Roseanne Barr to be the top-rated commercial of the telecast. The company determines that through a calculation that takes in viewership and how many times people rewind their DVRs to watch the ad. Second place was Best Buy's ad with Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne. \"Funny ads made it to the top,\" said Tara Maitra, TiVo's vice president and general manager for audience research and advertising sales. The Black Eyed Peas' halftime show, with guests Usher and Slash, held its own. TiVo said it had nearly identical viewer engagement numbers as shows with classic rockers over the past two years. People were much less likely to stop the game to repeat the ads in the second half, when the football action was compelling, Maitra said. No beer ads made TiVo's top 10 rated ads for the game. The average Super Bowl viewer with a DVR either paused, rewound or fast-forwarded 145 times during the game, TiVo said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6098480", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Saints", "Colts", "Ben Roethlisberger", "Mike Wallace"]}, {"title": "Poised Aaron Rodgers steadies Packers", "author": "Elizabeth Merrill", "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Now we'd seen it all. Forget Cowboys freezing over. Hell was about to do the same around 10 o'clock Sunday night, when a white-haired man walked down a long corridor and high-fived fans. Ted Thompson was smiling and chatty. That alone was breaking news. He was downright animated -- well, at least by Ted Thompson standards. \"You did the right thing, Ted!\" a middle-aged fan in a Packers jacket yelled. Thompson slapped hands with the man and kept going. He didn't need to say a thing. Aaron Rodgers said everything for him. For five years, they stuck together, their futures wound tightly. The Packers' general manager was one of the most vilified men in Packers for cutting ties with Brett Favre; Aaron Rodgers was the young quarterback getting defeated by Brett Favre last season. It all seemed so long ago Sunday night, when Aaron Rodgers made the rounds from one end of the locker room to the other after the Packers' 31-25 Super Bowl XLV victory, grabbing every player, assistant coach and equipment worker in a tight clench, telling them all he loved them. Brett Favre's name wasn't even uttered, mainly because so much has happened since then. There were the 15 guys who wound up on injured reserve this season, and the village it took to replace them. There were the losses of veterans Donald Driver and Charles Woodson on Sunday, and the main constant through it all was the Packers' quarterback, who never changed a thing. \"He's the focal point of our team,\" Thompson said. \"I think people are going to write stories about him 10 years from now that he's pretty special. Even though he's done so much, he's sort of just getting started.\" The composure Aaron Rodgers showed in those early post-Brett Favre days was on full display Sunday night. His receivers dropped six perfectly thrown strikes; Donald Driver was gone; and just about every ounce of momentum seemed to have been sapped from the Packers' sideline in the second half after the Steelers rallied from a 21-3 first-half deficit and brought the score to within a field goal with 7:34 to play. Not long after Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Ziggy Hood and LaMarr Woodley on the first play of the next drive, Packers faced third-and-10 on the 25-yard line. But the QB uncorked a 31-yarder to Greg Jennings, setting up Mason Crosby's 23-yard field goal. Aaron Rodgers exuded confidence all night. It started Sunday afternoon, when he sat in the corner of the locker room listening to his iPod. At halftime, while the Black Eyed Peas played outside, Aaron Rodgers took off his pads and joked around with his teammates about the lengthy Super Bowl intermission. It was Aaron Rodgers' first Super Bowl, against a team so postseason savvy, but Aaron Rodgers was the one who gave off the vibe that he'd been here before. Maybe it's because every game since December has been an elimination game, and the Packers very well might not have even been here if the Giants hadn't squandered a three-touchdown lead to Eagles in one of the final games of the regular season. Aaron Rodgers was determined not to let the Packers squander their lead, or their chance. \"We just felt confident we were going to be able to move the football,\" Aaron Rodgers said, \"as long as we blocked them up front.\" Donald Driver said he found Aaron Rodgers on the sideline in the third quarter, sometime after James Jones dropped an open-field pass that might've gone for a touchdown. (James Jones later redeemed himself with a clutch catch on the Packers' fourth-quarter touchdown drive.) Donald Driver, 36, an old friend of Brett Favre's, just looked at Aaron Rodgers and smiled after the drop. Then Aaron Rodgers smiled too. \"I don't think he ever got down on himself,\" Donald Driver said. \"I looked at him, and I just told him,'Go ahead, do what you do.' \"Nothing changed for Aaron [this season]. I've been knowing Aaron since'05. And he's the same guy. Day in and day out. Now he just has a little more swagger about him. That's what I told him earlier,'You've always had this cockiness and confidence. Now it's even bigger.' I take my hat off to him. He's one of the best quarterbacks in the game.\" When it was over, and Aaron Rodgers had thrown for 304 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, he was the Super Bowl MVP. It's an award Brett Favre never got. But no one was thinking about ghosts late Sunday. Aaron Rodgers was scurried from interview to interview until he started to cramp. He spotted his grandparents in the melee of confetti and people and stopped to take a picture with them. He joked around with his older brother, Luke, who teammates say is a dead ringer for Aaron. At one point, Luke doubled for his brother and did an interview with backup quarterback Graham Harrell. They joked about that, how Luke fooled some reporter. And the Packers' three quarterbacks -- Aaron Rodgers, Matt Flynn and Harrell -- stood in the corner of the locker room and laughed late into the night. Thanks for the ride, Aaron Rodgers told his backups. Then Aaron Rodgers sat on the wooden bench alone, his feet propped up, and just stared at the scene with a sly grin that never went away. All of the Packers' quarterbacks are under the age of 28, and they're brother-close. After Aaron Rodgers suffered his second concussion of the season in December, he flew to Patriots and threw on a headset, trying to help Flynn knock off the Patriots. \"He's on cloud nine right now,\" Harrell said. \"You can just tell by looking at him.\" So was Thompson, in his own private way. He has always been the quiet type, so reserved that a few local media types have called him hermitlike. He builds teams through the draft instead of going for quick fixes, which hasn't always been a popular philosophy for fans in Packers. But not anymore. Thompson was a role player at best in his playing days in the NFL, but the former linebacker has said this is what he loves best about his job, the camaraderie in the locker room. He was asked whether he felt vindicated and said he doesn't think about stuff like that. He said he felt relieved. \"I've said this over and over,\" Thompson said. \"A team is something very, very special. A championship team that goes through all the things this one went through is remarkably special.\" And Aaron Rodgers didn't want it to end Sunday night. He was one of the last to linger in the locker room, so late the Packers' five buses were nearly full and had their engines running. He walked to the last bus just after 11 p.m. as the drivers tried to warm themselves and ate sliders. He hugged his agent, David Dunn. He hugged the bus driver. Then Aaron Rodgers, sharply dressed in a gray suit and a blue shirt, walked up the steps and took a seat near the back of the bus. He stood in the aisle and danced for his teammates, swaying back and forth. He was no longer another legend's replacement. There was never any doubt.

The Packers were a problem for the Bears this season and they are going to continue to make life difficult for them. Of course, nothing is a certainty, particularly in the NFL, this season being a convenient reminder if one is still needed. But if there is a 2011 season, the Packers will be there and likely posing an even bigger obstacle. The Packers defeated the Steelers on Sunday largely without Charles Woodson and Donald Driver, and as we all know by now, they reached the Super Bowl without their leading running back in Ryan Grant, their star tight end in Jermichael Finley and one of their talented linebackers, Nick Barnett. If and when free agency begins, there are few losses with the exception of Cullen Jenkins and maybe A.J. Hawk ( Charlie Peprah, Brandon Jackson and Atari Bigby are also on that list) that threaten to really hurt them. How will the Packers respond to wearing the proverbial bull's-eye? Since 1999, beginning with the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos and runner-up Falcons -- who both finished 14-2 in the'98 season and fell to 6-10 and 5-11 respectively the next year -- the Super Bowl hangover has been a bit of a headache. With the exception of Patriots, defending conference champions since 1999 have had only 10 winning records. According to AdvancedNFLStats.com, all 24 Super Bowl participants since then -- including the Patriots -- have compiled on average a.560 winning percentage the following season, which is just shy of 9-7. We have no idea if the Packers, like the'85 Bears, will fight over endorsements, become jealous over attention or merely get fat and happy. But they are probably too young to get fat, and happiness can only be a bonus spending winters in Packers. How will the Bears respond to a season in which they seemed to rely heavily on the age-old, no one-gave-us-a-chance tactic? Every Super Bowl the Bears aren't in, which is to say all but one the past 25 years, I can't help but picture them in the game and ask myself if they belong. Usually watching the NFL's best only reminds me of how far away the Bears remain. Obviously, they were only one win short this year, and yet I never felt they truly belonged among the final two teams playing for the championship. From the Packers' first touchdown in the NFC Championship Game, I never really believed the Bears had a chance to advance to the Super Bowl. And even during their five-game win streak following the bye, I never really felt they were a scorching hot, Super Bowl-bound club hitting on all cylinders as I did with the Packers. And now the bad news. The Bears may never get another opportunity like the one that presented itself this season. All together now: The almost complete lack of injuries; the officiating break to seal the Lions game; facing third-string quarterbacks in Panthers and Dolphins; getting Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs; the opportunity to play the conference title game at home. Those chances just don't come along every year. Yawn, if you must, at the repetitive nature of all of this, but the season was teed up for the Bears and, ultimately, it doesn't matter if they finished with a better record than many of us thought they would. In a purely visceral take, I found the end to the Bears' season to be as strange and unpredictable and ultimately unsatisfying as far worse campaigns, despite the lofty record. In a bizarre local reaction to Jay Cutler's cruddy performance in the first half of the NFC Championship Game, followed by his legitimate knee injury and sulking on the sideline, it is now suddenly met with horror and disgust to question anything from the bravery to the leadership skills to the clothes choice of the Bears quarterback. This is not to suggest that if Jay Cutler gave a rousing halftime speech or stood cheering on the sideline the Bears would have rallied to beat the Packers. I am only going by what Packers players said about the added motivation they felt after teammate Charles Woodson's emotional words of encouragement to them in the locker room at halftime of the Super Bowl. Read whatever you'd like into it. Either way, it's on to next season and the prospect of a young division rival with its window opening wider as the window for the Bears and their aging defense begins to close. In a conference in which all four teams are capable of taking a game against each other, the question is whether the Bears can climb past the Packers and win the division again because they certainly do not want to take a chance on winning a wild card. I liked the Packers this season. I thought Aaron Rodgers was thrilling to watch. I thought even when they lost, you felt like they were going to pull it together and even in the end, when they had to essentially play and win six straight playoff games, that they had a legitimate chance. And that chance just doesn't look like it's going anywhere.

A bleary-eyed Aaron Rodgers glanced at the Vince Lombardi Trophy on Monday morning and talked about collecting a few more. So did his coach, Mike McCarthy. Aaron Rodgers led the Packers to a 31-25 victory over the Steelers for the storied franchise's fourth Super Bowl title and 13th NFL championship. Before accepting the game's MVP award and a car, Aaron Rodgers spoke of the next goals for him and the team. \"I guess I ran out of motivations, huh?\" Aaron Rodgers said with a chuckle. \"I always look for challenges. The challenge goes to repeating. We've got one, so now what? Let's go get another one.\" Aaron Rodgers guided the Packers to three straight road victories in the playoffs before Sunday's win over Steelers that made Packers the second number 6 seed to win a Super Bowl. He threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns against the Steelers' second-ranked defense, and the Packers displayed a resilience that marked their season. Packers had lost 16 players to injured reserve heading into the Super Bowl, then defensive leader Charles Woodson (collarbone) and veteran receiver Donald Driver (ankle) went down Sunday. The ability to rally when faced with adversity will serve the Packers well as they defend their first title since the 1996 season. \"I think the core and nucleus of this team is intact to make a run like this for a few years,\" Aaron Rodgers said. Mike McCarthy, who along with general manager Ted Thompson built these Packers, agreed with the quarterback he bypassed in the 2005 draft while the offensive coordinator in 49ers -- something Aaron Rodgers frequently reminds the coach about. \"This is an excellent football team I feel will grow and get better,\" said Mike McCarthy, who carried the Lombardi Trophy in one hand into a conference room. \"You give a good message that it's about the team and growth and development.\" And confidence. Mike McCarthy had so much faith in his team that he fitted the players for championship rings the night before the Super Bowl. Aaron Rodgers missed that, however, saying he was taking a shower. Somehow, he'll probably get his ring size measured. \"We've talked to the football team about being real confident and this was an opportunity to express that,\" Mike McCarthy said. \"The measurement of rings would have a significant effect on the team the night before the game.\" In addition to rings, the Packers will also get to meet President Barack Obama, who spoke with Mike McCarthy and congratulated the Packers on their Super Bowl victory. Obama, a noted Bears supporter, said \"even a Bears fan\" could appreciate what the win meant for the division rival from Wisconsin. While Mike McCarthy was fielding presidential phone calls, Aaron Rodgers spent the better part of his day in Orlando. The Super Bowl MVP celebrated the Packers victory with a ticker-tape parade through Disney World's Magic Kingdom a night after taking part in the 25th anniversary edition of Disney's \"I'm going to Disney World\" commercial. Aaron Rodgers and Mike McCarthy have a solid relationship, certainly stronger than coach and quarterback shared when Brett Favre was taking snaps in Mike McCarthy's first two years with the Packers. Aaron Rodgers jokes that he still carries a grudge for not being drafted by the 49ers -- Aaron Rodgers was a college star at Cal and grew up a Niners fan -- but he's thankful to be working with an offense-minded coach with a keen eye for talent. And Aaron Rodgers is over having to sit for three seasons behind Brett Favre before getting a chance to start. \"That's kind of been my career journey, waiting for opportunities and then making the most of it,\" Aaron Rodgers said. \"Mike is a players' coach. He thinks there's a negative connotation to that, but to me it means he allows input from his players. He allows input in the schedule and the way we do things and he sets up a routine that allows players to be successful, and allowing the coaches to coach.\" The future for Aaron Rodgers, Mike McCarthy and the Packers is murky because of a potential work stoppage as the union and league negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. If labor issues get settled and 2011 is a normal NFL year, Aaron Rodgers can't wait to get started on defending the crown. There is, after all, much improvement to be done. \"Being a perfectionist,\" he said, \"there are plenty of things to work on and plenty of time to work on them.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6098287", "Entities": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Mike McCarthy", "Packers", "Steelers", "Charles Woodson", "Donald Driver", "49ers", "Bears", "Brett Favre"]}, {"title": "Fans get Super Bowl tix for next year", "author": null, "date": "Feb 7, 2011", "content": "Fans displaced by seating issues for Sunday night's Super Bowl get another chance next year. The 400 people without seats will be \"guests of the NFL\" at Super Bowl XLVI in Colts, commissioner Roger Goodell said on Monday. The fans also received triple the face value of their 2011 tickets, which is $2,400, free merchandise, food and beverages, and were allowed to go on the field at Cowboys Stadium after the game. Goodell said the problems with the seats were \"obviously a failure on our behalf,\" and the league takes responsibility. \"Any time you put on an event of this magnitude, you have your challenges,\" Goodell said in a statement. \"We apologize to those fans that were impacted. We are going to work with them and we are going to do better in the future. We will certainly do a thorough review and get to the bottom of why it all occurred, but we take full responsibility for that as putting on this game. \"But the one thing we will never do is compromise safety -- safety for our fans, safety for our players, anyone involved with our event.\" Goodell said \"there's no excuses\" for fans having to give up their spots in the stands because of structural issues with temporary seating. When asked if North Texas will get to host another Super Bowl in the future, Goodell applauded the efforts of the host committee. \"Sure, it's a membership vote, but I think they did an outstanding job,\" Goodell said. \"It was a great event, and I'm sure that they'll be seeking another Super Bowl. I'm sure the ownership will look at that very seriously.\" \"At the end of the day, the game on the field, and the stadium where it was played, exceeded the high level of expectation that the Super Bowl presents,\" Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones said in a statement. \"It was a great game in a great venue, and it was an experience that will begin the process of bringing future Super Bowls to North Texas. \"Our region displayed the type of tremendous commitment of resources, services, enthusiasm, and hospitality that validates our community as a most worthy home to this wonderful event in the years to come.\" NFL executive vice president Eric Grubman said the final installation of railings, risers and steps in certain sections was the problem, but that none of the design was added at the last minute. He said the problem was strictly an installation issue. \"We had a plan that was approved by the authorities, and... safety was a paramount concern,\" Grubman said. \"We simply ran out of time on a couple of sections. It's a shared responsibility, but it's our overall responsibility to manage that. \"The fire marshal did not step in late, neither did the police. They were there with us every step of the way. We were in consultation with them. We were in agreement with them. There were no disputes. Everybody was looking at it the same way. In fact, what they did helped us gain time to try to get it done, and at the end, we just ran out of time.\" Two hours before the game, workers were frantically trying to fix the sections or get the fans \"relocated to similar or better seats,\" valued at $800. The NFL found alternate seating for 850 of the 1,250 fans affected. \"We made a judgment that we had a very good shot to be able to complete it,\" Grubman said. \"We made a judgment that it was the right course of action to bring the fans in, rather than discourage them, or create a sense that they wouldn't have the information necessary.\" The NFL tried to placate those 400 fans, taking them inside the stadium to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench. They also had the option of viewing the game from standing-room platforms in each corner of the stadium. Those fans will still get the triple refund. After saying all week that he expected Sunday's game to set an all-time Super Bowl attendance record with 105,000 fans seated inside the stadium, Jones came up short as the announced attendance of 103,219 was just shy of the 103,985 mark set in Super Bowl XIV between the Los Angeles Rams and Steelers at the Rose Bowl. Based on the 850 seats that were forfeited by the NFL and Cowboys to make room for those who were relocated, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed Sunday that the seating debacle was the reason the attendance record was not set. \"The attendance record was not the goal,\" Grubman said. \"The goal was to use this great building in a way that showcased the NFL, showcased North Texas and showcased some great players that we have in the NFL. And if we can come up with a better installation plan for a future event, we'll do that.\" Stadium workers were covering the top corner sections of the upper deck behind one end zone two hours prior to kickoff. There were off-limits seats in the same upper-deck rows as seats that were deemed safe. Yellow police tape was used as a dividing line, with uniformed personnel also keeping folks away. The fans affected were directed to the Party Plaza area, which is located outside the stadium for the Super Bowl. The temporary-seating sections were erected in what is usually an open area. Fans can purchase $29 \"Party Passes\" to stand in the open areas during Cowboys games. There was other bad news for the first Super Bowl in the Cowboys area. A rare winter storm swept across the area Tuesday, ripping holes in tents on stadium property and hampering travel and celebrations across the region. On Friday, six people at the stadium were injured by melting snow falling from the stadium roof.

He made jokes about how he expected a gold watch after 30 years with the franchise, how it will be easier for his mother to see him on the sideline now and even poked fun at his quiet manner. \"This is my excited face,\" Mike Munchak said at one point. The new coach also made one thing very clear: Change is coming, even though he coached under Jeff Fisher the past 14 seasons. \"I'm going to be my own man, and I'll be judged by what I do and not what was done before me. I'm not looking here to blame anybody about what was left for me,\" Mike Munchak said. \"I think it's a great opportunity here with what we have, and I think I'm the guy to pick up the pieces and hopefully get us in the right direction.\" Mike Munchak is the franchise's 16th head coach but just its second since relocating from Texans to Titans in 1997. Neither he nor the Titans would comment on his new contract. The Titans decided to promote from within to replace Jeff Fisher after a 6-10 season. Owner Bud Adams called the move a special day for the franchise as Mike Munchak became the first former player to coach the team. \"He has been a hard worker, and he has only known success and how to achieve success,\" Adams said by telephone from his Texans office. \"He made it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He has the respect of people he played with and those who have played for him. He is a smart football man and leader who will guide us again into the playoffs.\" Mike Munchak was the first man interviewed to replace Jeff Fisher and had been considered the top candidate for the job. This is the first head coaching job for Mike Munchak, who turns 51 in March, with the only franchise the offensive line coach and Hall of Fame lineman has ever played or worked for since being selected eighth overall by the then-Texans Oilers in 1982. General manager Mike Reinfeldt and senior executive vice president Steve Underwood also interviewed offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger and wrapped up interviews Friday by talking to Falcons offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey and Giants defensive coordinator Perry Fewell in the same day. Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams declined to interview. But Mike Munchak is well respected in the franchise. Reinfeldt, a former teammate, called Mike Munchak a smart football man who commands respect and accountability. \"He is a leader,\" Reinfeldt said. \"I think he has a vision, and he has great passion for it. I think it's good. He has an understanding of our people, what we've done here, and I think he has a vision of how he'd take it to the next level.\" Mike Munchak will have flexibility to fill his staff as he wants, even though 13 current assistants are under contract. That includes Heimerdinger, who said by text to the AP that he is happy for Mike Munchak and expects him to do a good job. He isn't committing to anyone just yet. \"I feel like we're starting fresh. It's not same old, same old. We come in, sit down and figure out what's best for the Titans going forward with what we have.... Anything's possible,\" Mike Munchak said. Mike Munchak has to fill at least five positions left open by his promotion, the firing of defensive coordinator Chuck Cecil and departures of assistants coaching defensive line, running backs and wide receivers. His best friend and former teammate Bruce Matthews is considered a possibility to replace him on the line, but he is an offensive assistant coach with the Texans. Mike Munchak's promotion is being praised by those who know him with Penn State coach Joe Paterno calling him a hard worker. Lions coach Jim Schwartz said he didn't realize how respected Mike Munchak is throughout the NFL until he left Titans. \"I am known as someone who burns the midnight oil, and consistently Mike Munchak's car was the only one left in the parking lot when I left. Titans fans can sleep well knowing Munch is at the helm. I know I did,\" Jim Schwartz said in a statement. Coming out of Penn State, the left guard blocked for fellow Hall of Famers Earl Campbell in the pounding run game of the run-and-shoot offense with Warren Moon. He played 159 regular season games with the Oilers before retiring in 1994, and he became the fifth player from the franchise inducted into the Hall of Fame -- the first to spend his entire career with Adams' team. Mike Munchak also had the club record with nine Pro Bowl berths during his career. Adams retired Mike Munchak's number 63 in 1996, joining Campbell, Jim Norton and Elvin Bethea in rare company with that honor. Moon said in a statement released by the Titans that \"it was just a matter of time until he would have success in coaching. Some folks have to go the coordinator route to reach the head coaching level, but being in the organization as long as he has, there is a comfort level with him and everyone knows who he is as a coach and a person.\" He started at the entry-level position as quality control assistant with the offensive staff through 1996. Jeff Fisher promoted Mike Munchak to offensive line coach in 1997, a job he held the past 14 seasons. Mike Munchak thanked Jeff Fisher for the opportunity. Mike Munchak has only had the same starting five offensive linemen from one season to the next twice during his 14 seasons. But he has had four players earn 10 total Pro Bowl invitations while blocking for five different running backs in 11 1,000-yard seasons ranging from Eddie George to Chris Johnson. With Mike Munchak coaching the offensive line, the Titans allowed the second fewest sacks in the NFL with 28.3 sacks per season and ranked seventh in the league in that time averaging 124.5 yards rushing per game. Left tackle Michael Roos was a second-round pick in 2005 and has started every game since being drafted. Mike Munchak's right tackle is David Stewart, a fourth-round pick in 2005, while center Eugene Amano was a seventh-round pick in 2004. \"He is an intense guy, but he is not a screamer or a yeller,\" Michael Roos said. \"He just gets the most out of his players because you want to do well for him.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6098619", "Entities": ["Mike Munchak", "Titans", "Jeff Fisher", "Texans", "Falcons", "Mike Mularkey", "Giants", "Saints", "Lions", "Jim Schwartz", "Chris Johnson", "Michael Roos", "David Stewart", "Eugene Amano"]}, {"title": "How 'The Fridge' lost his way", "author": "Tom Friend", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "AIKEN, S.C. -- Every day begins with William Perry needing help out of bed. Usually, it's 10 a.m. before he even gives it a try, and to support his 400 pounds, he shuffles to the living room on two legs that barely work and his sturdy black cane. Once he sits down, he and his chair are in a long-term relationship. He doesn't move, except to go to the bathroom, and the concerning part is that he has no desire to move. A home gym is just 20 feet away from him, but he mostly scowls at it from a safe distance. A walking path is only 40 feet away, but he mostly hisses at it from the comfort of his seat. His day consists of watching television and eating three or four meals prepared by his heart-broken wife, Valerie. She nags him to exercise, but says she gets \"cussed out'' for it. She bugs him to take his medication but says she gets ignored over it. Her new trick, just to get him on his feet, is to tell him he has to come to the kitchen to eat his lunch. That's her best way to get \"The Refrigerator'' to walk near the refrigerator. Of course, then when she least expects it, her husband will hobble out the door and into his car. She knows exactly where he's headed: to the liquor store. Because every day ends with William Perry needing a drink. The rise was so much less complicated than the fall. William Perry, now 48, was once America's mascot -- a pear-shaped, gap-toothed football player who could sing, dance, sack quarterbacks, score touchdowns and muss Mike Ditka's hair. The fact that he did it with an innocent smile made it all the more endearing. But, turns out, he was never as innocent as he seemed. The insecurities came early. It's hard enough weighing 200 pounds in the sixth grade, but it's even worse if your front tooth's been shot out. William was in grammar school when one of his cousins mischievously pulled the trigger of a BB gun, blasting William straight in the mouth. One of his front two teeth was splintered. So William entered his Aiken high school as, essentially, the funny-looking fat kid. One way to shut everyone up was to become an athletic marvel, and that's exactly what William turned into. He could do flips off the pool's diving board, could throw down a 360-degree dunk in basketball and could out-run some of the fleetest members of the football team. During practice one day, coach Eddie Buck said, \"I want all my fastest guys to line up for a 100-yard dash.'' A couple of wide receivers, a couple of running backs and a defensive back stepped forward -- soon joined by William. \"What're you doing?'' Buck asked his 295-pound nose tackle. \"You said you wanted your fastest guys, didn't you?'' William said. William eventually timed out as the sixth-fastest on the team. College coaches were bound to knock on his door, and before long Perry had a full scholarship offer to Clemson. In case he didn't notice, he wasn't the ugly duckling anymore. He had a high school sweetheart and a secret admirer -- both of whom would become the two women in his life -- and when he showed up on the Clemson campus, he started to come out of his shell. His freshman season of 1981 was about as good as it gets. Not only did his Tigers walk away with the national championship, but he walked away with a nickname for the ages. He was taking an elevator up to his dorm room one day, carrying a load of laundry, when fellow defensive lineman Ray Brown walked in with his own load of clothes. There was barely any room in the elevator for either of them to breathe, at which point Brown announced, \"Man, you're about as big as a refrigerator.'' That's all it took: the kid was forever more Refrigerator Perry -- or \"Fridge'' for short. Perry might have been ambivalent about the nickname, but he was ecstatic to be one of the guys. Or at least he assumed he was one of the guys. When the players went out partying, they made sure the Fridge came along, if only for the entertainment value. One thing about being a 300-pounder -- a six pack doesn't even crack the surface. He says he could drink two cases of beer in one sitting -- maybe three on a hot, steamy day -- and his teammates all wanted to be witnesses, as in every weekend. When he came back to Aiken that summer, his younger brother Daryl saw him throw down a six pack or three and remembers thinking, \"This is getting out of hand.'' But Daryl also figured it was just a college phase his brother was in. Surely, when the Bears picked the 325-pound Perry in the first round of the 1985 draft four years later, the Fridge would get serious. Right? He'd go to Chi-town, bring his lunch bucket and get to work. Right? He'd just blend in and be anonymous, overshadowed by Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Jim McMahon. Right? Right? From the start, Perry was a just pawn in the verbal spat between Ditka and Buddy Ryan. Ditka, the head coach, personally scouted the Fridge and advocated selecting him in the first round. Ryan, the defensive coordinator, threw up his hands on draft day and called it a wasted pick. Welcome to the NFL. At least Perry had support from his high school sweetheart, Sherry. They married in 1982 while he was at Clemson, and by 1985 they were the parents of a 3-year-old daughter, Latavia, with another one on the way. Ryan would barely let Perry on the field the first half of the season, but from all appearances, the Fridge seemed like a grounded, non-descript family man who would persevere. He had no problem covering kickoffs. But while Ryan was holding the Fridge ransom, Ditka had a wonderful, awful idea. Against the Packers, on Monday night Oct. 21, 1985, the coach decided to move the kid to offense. The 49ers had used guard Guy McIntyre as a short-yardage fullback against the Bears the year prior, and Ditka decided if anyone was a born blocking back, it was Perry. McIntyre could open a hole; the Fridge could blow one to pieces. With an entire nation watching, Ditka waved Perry in on a goal-to-go situation from the 2-yard line. The Fridge lined up in front and to the right of Payton and was told to eliminate any linebacker directly between him and the goal line. That poor soul was Packers's George Cumby. \"It was like a Mack truck smashing a Volkswagen,'' says Fridge, laughing. \"I thought he killed him,'' says former Bears tackle Jimbo Covert. \"Cumby wasn't the same for the rest of his career,'' says another former Bear, safety Dave Duerson. Payton scored amid the wreckage, and Ditka's mind started racing. The next time the Bears reached the 1-yard line, he lined up the Fridge in the same spot and ordered McMahon to hand him the ball. Easiest touchdown you ever saw. The Fridge danced and spiked the ball. Frank Gifford, usually calm and collected during \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts, was giggling. The next time the Bears reached the 1, Ditka directed the Fridge to the front and left of Payton and asked him again to seek out a linebacker. Cumby was back for more -- and got pancaked. Payton could've scored with his eyes closed. The fallout was off the charts. In the ensuing weeks, Perry appeared on David Letterman's show, the \"Tonight Show\" and a Bob Hope Christmas special. McDonald's and Coca-Cola also hopped into the Fridge conga line. Mr. T wanted him for his \"A-Team'' action show. Oh, and Ryan wanted him on defense, too. The quiet, ugly duckling from Aiken was a sudden icon, and that was a little bit of an adjustment. Fortunately for Perry, Bears players convened every Thursday for a night of food and drink -- and more drink -- and the camaraderie felt a lot like Clemson. He got to be one of the guys again, which is all he ever wanted, and he blew off steam by drinking his usual two or three cases. \"I couldn't say no,'' he says. Ditka and the rest of the organization caught wind of it -- \"I didn't realize how much beer he could drink,'' the coach says -- and they filed that away for future reference. But in the short term, the Fridge was now alongside Payton, Mike Singletary and McMahon on the team marquee and had a solo in the Bears' legendary \"Super Bowl Shuffle:\" You're lookin' at the Fridge I'm the rookie. I may be large, but I'm no dumb cookie. You've seen me hit, you've seen me run, When I kick and pass, we'll have more fun. I can dance, you will see. The others, they all learn from me. I don't come here lookin' for trouble. I just came here to do The Super Bowl Shuffle. Not only could he carry a tune, he got to carry the ball in the ensuing Super Bowl XX, scoring on a 1-yard blast -- the operative word being blast. He was just following orders and had no idea his TD would cost Payton a chance of getting in a Super Bowl end zone. He loved Payton; he and Ditka both have said they wish they had it to do over. But the truth was, the Fridge was now not only a household appliance, he was a household name. Perry's way of celebrating was getting away from it all. In other words, he returned to Aiken, dug out his fishing pole and drove to the nearest lake. He sat all by himself for hours. Just him, the trout and the beer. He came back to Bears for the 1986 season weighing upwards of 340 pounds. The Bears were not pleased, and it'd be a constant theme the rest of the Fridge's career. His hype never matched his production. Off the field, he was beginning to command anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 for 90-minute personal appearances, and considering his rookie salary had been $138,250, this was nothing to sniff at. He was not a Pro Bowl-caliber player, and he'd never end up with more than 5\u00bd sacks in a season. But he did ads for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, Mr. Big Paper Towels, bacon products and a supermarket chain in Europe. There was even a G.I. Joe action-figure doll of the Fridge. The Bears didn't want a carnival act; they wanted someone to dig in and stop the run. His weigh-ins became a source of contention, and by 1987, Ditka -- the person who made him a star -- was starting to grow irritated. \"We had weigh-ins, and we fined him,'' Ditka says. \"And it was fruitless after a while. I didn't want to take his money. He couldn't get it down at that point.'' Bears management felt his drinking was at the core of it all. Perry had branched out from beer to vodka, and he says Sherry, at home, was griping about the hours he kept and the alcohol he consumed. \"It wasn't one or two beers, I'll tell you that,'' he says. \"I mean, it was a whole lot.'' Eventually, in 1988, Perry says Sherry flat-out told him he had a problem and needed treatment, and he says they decided he would go first to trainer Fred Caito and admit he had a problem. \"And it was a big problem,'' Perry says. \"I got my family here and my career here and I'm sitting here in the middle, and I'm stuck. So I have to do something, you know, have to reach out and get some help.'' He says Caito heard the news and immediately went upstairs to tell Ditka. The organization then arranged for Perry to go to an undisclosed alcohol rehab center, and he says Ditka pulled him aside before he left. \"He told me,'Big Guy, you got to handle the situation and get some help,'\" William says. \"He said,'You ain't the only one, so don't worry about it. Just go through it, get some help and you'll be fine.'\" The Fridge spent 28 days in treatment and began going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, even though he couldn't possibly have been anonymous. \"My name is William, and I'm an alcoholic,'' he says he'd say at meetings. That was murder for him to admit. And after he stopped AA after about just eight meetings, he wouldn't admit it again for years. By the end of his Bears career, the Fridge was still drinking and still botching his weigh-ins. His highest unconfirmed playing weight was 382, but because Ditka still had a soft spot for him, he wasn't going anywhere. \"I would never trade him,'' Ditka says. However, once Dave Wannstedt replaced Ditka in 1993, the Fridge was gone, off to the Eagles. Members of the Bears organization from the 1980s, such as public relations director Ken Valdiserri, remember their regret when they heard the news, how sad they felt about what might have been. \"His weight was just a constant issue,'' Valdiserri says. \"Particularly after that first year because he couldn't manage his weight in the offseason.... I really believe if he would have worked in the offseason like some players do today that he could have set some unique records for not only offensively but defensively. He really could have become a Hall of Fame player had he taken care of himself in the offseason.'' Instead, he left the NFL in 1994 with a paltry total of 29\u00bd sacks. He didn't seem over-concerned, though, and, to this day, says he's convinced he reached his full potential. Besides, the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football were calling, not to mention the World Wrestling Federation. After playing one unremarkable season in London, he embarked on his career after football, and it was a busy one. Between the wrestling and a hot dog eating contest -- he quit after eating four dogs in five minutes -- and a boxing match against 7-foot-7 Manute Bol -- lost a unanimous decision -- his Q rating was virtually as high as his playing days. He had started a construction company with his wife's father and lived in an 18,000-square-foot home with Sherry and their four children. The decorative iron gates out front were in the shape of footballs, and he began building other homes in and around Aiken with his buddies -- drinking on the job and not giving it a second thought. The opportunities were everywhere, and so was the booze. He could sign autographs for an hour and make an easy 10 grand; the drinks were always on the house. But by 2003, Sherry was intent on asking for a divorce. Their breakup was messy, and because Aiken was a small town, almost everyone knew that he was pining to win Sherry back. On Christmas Eve that year, he was doing last-minute shopping, planning to bring a satchel full of presents to Sherry and the kids. Along the way, he bumped into the secret admirer from his high school days, an old classmate named Valerie who had never told him about her teenage crush on him. Valerie asked him where he was headed with all the gifts, and he told her, \"I'm trying to get back with my wife.'' She wished him luck, but the truth is, she crossed her fingers that he'd be a free man. Valerie had been eye-balling him ever since she was a freshman at Aiken High and William was a senior. Twenty-odd years later, she still thought he was cute. Within 15 months, they were a couple. William and Sherry had split for good, and William found himself despondent and looking for company. He was the 10th of 12 children, and all of his brothers and sisters had never seen him so depressed. Valerie tried to be there for him, and he immersed himself in whatever business opportunities he could muster, including participating in the 2006 Lingerie Bowl. But none of that could relieve his heartache. Sherry had custody of the four kids -- three daughters and a son, William Jr. -- as well as possession of their 18,000-square-foot home along Aiken's Route 19. All he had was that unfinished brick house on the north side of Aiken, and whenever he looked at himself in the mirror, he didn't like what he saw. So he decided to do something about it. He fixed his teeth. It made news in the local newspaper -- the Fridge's gap-toothed smile was no more. He wasn't messing around. He had all of his upper and lower teeth pulled and replaced. His smile was radiant. The only hitch was that in the ensuing days and weeks, he developed an infection in his mouth. A doctor prescribed antibiotics, but Perry had always been resistant to taking any sort of medication. It must've been a macho thing; he never had a valid answer as to why. But the longer he ignored his medicine, the sorer his mouth became. And the more his gums hurt, the more he began to drink vodka. He kept a gallon of it on his window sill. \"Whenever he would drink, he didn't feel any pain,'' says Daryl. \"So he was masking the pain with the alcohol.'' All that being said, the doctors can only theorize now about what happened next. Because at some point in 2007, after the dental work, Perry's feet began going numb. And then his knees. And then his hands. For all intents and purposes, the Fridge was becoming frozen solid. \"I couldn't get up,'' he says. \"I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything, couldn't hold a fork or spoon or anything.'' Most people would have hurried as fast as they could to a doctor, but Perry stayed for months upon end in his unfinished brick home, ignoring his body that was screaming out to him. His bride-to-be Valerie says she pleaded for him to go to the hospital, but he would wave her off. \"I played football, you know,'' he says. \"And whenever you broke something, you keep playing. No worry, you keep going and not run to a doctor. You don't run going,'Mama, mama, mama.' So you know, I just ignored it.'' But once he was on the verge of paralysis, and was having trouble hearing, Valerie got her way in June of 2008. Perry was taken to Aiken Regional Medical Centers and diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a disorder triggered when a person's immune system attacks his peripheral nervous system. It can start as muscle weakness and result in paralysis and death, and Perry had an advanced case. Daryl says he was told by doctors that the mouth infection could have caused it and that the heavy drinking could have exacerbated it. Either way, the Fridge was in the hospital for five months. He didn't feel like flashing his brand new smile. It's bad enough having an illness you can't pronounce. But it's worse when the doctors tell you there's a chance you'll never be cured. Guillain-Barre Syndrome, even when treated thoroughly, can resurface 3 percent of the time, according to medical journals, and Perry was warned when he left Aiken Regional Medical Centers to curtail his alcohol use. Valerie says she kept the beer and vodka away from him as best she could, and because he was still rather immobile and confined mostly to a wheelchair, she couldn't imagine him finding his way to a liquor store. She was dead wrong. While she was out running errands, he would ease himself into his car and buy his beer and vodka. Valerie would smell it on his breath, but Perry told her to look on the bright side: at least he was getting some exercise by going to the store. Over the next few months, he was a relative hermit -- seen only in public on his way to and from the liquor store -- and few realized he'd developed a hacking cough, that he was wasting away. The weight was slowly coming off him, for reasons Valerie couldn't figure out. But soon his wife was about to have some witnesses. In March 2009, Perry told Valerie he wanted to fly to an autograph show in the Bears suburb of Rosemont. He'd heard players and coaches from the'85 Bears would be attending, and it was the first thing in months that made him smile. Valerie told him, \"Will, you're too sick to go,'' but he wasn't hearing her. He wouldn't even wear a jacket when he landed at O'Hare. He entered the room in a wheelchair, and 75 heads turned straight to him. Duerson, the former Bears safety, was certain the Fridge had suffered a stroke. Ditka, meanwhile, was speechless. But after a minute of reflection, he morphed into Coach Dik-a from the'80s. While Valerie pushed the wheelchair, the old coach went charging up to the Fridge and started motivating him to get healthy. \"We're gonna get you some help and you're going to listen to everything she tells you!'' Valerie remembers the coach howling. \"You're gonna do what she tells you!'' Perry tried laughing his old Fridge laugh, but the sound that came out of his mouth was muffled. This was not the William Perry that Ditka championed all those years. Fridge could barely move his hand to sign autographs and spoke slowly, choppily. He squinted when he looked at his old buddies and was hearing only about every fifth word. Duerson and the other players would ask him if he was OK, and Fridge would announce, \"Sure, of course.'' But there was a sense he had brain damage, and when Valerie was standing by herself, she says a litany of players would approach her to say basically the same thing: \"You've got to find out what's wrong with him. Something's wrong with him.'' There was an overall sense of sadness permeating the room. A videographer hired for the event didn't film the Fridge out of pity. When Perry was wheeled out of the event that day, Duerson told people they might never see him again. And sure enough, after Valerie chaperoned him back to Aiken, his condition turned dire. On an April afternoon in 2009, his blood pressure dropped. Valerie began to panic, but, fortuitously, Daryl and Daryl's wife, Tavy, happened to stop by that night after going to dinner. \"We said,'Let's go see bro' and see how he's doing,''' Daryl says. \"When we got in the house, he was lying motionless. He wasn't moving. He wasn't blinking. I was tapping him on the shoulder, yelling at him, just trying to get a response. Nothing. So we called the paramedics.'' Consensus from the doctors is that Perry nearly died that day. Not only had he suffered a relapse of Guillain-Barre, he had pneumonia. He couldn't hear out of his right ear and couldn't see more than five feet in front of him. Worse yet, the Fridge -- famous the world over for his stomach -- weighed exactly 190 pounds. The news traveled to two important places: Bears and Charlotte, N.C. Up in the Windy City, Valdiserri and Ditka began brainstorming ways to help. Both were involved with Gridiron Greats, an organization that supports former players in need, and no one was in more need than the Fridge. Told that Perry was malnourished and would need extensive speech and physical therapy, Valdiserri and Ditka reached out to Dr. James A. Sliwa of Northwestern Memorial Hospital. They also contacted Perry's brother, Michael Dean Perry, a former 285-pound NFL defensive tackle himself who was living in Charlotte. Sliwa lent his expertise to all of them in a conference call, and it was decided that Ditka and Gridiron Greats would help pay for Fridge's admittance to Pantherss Rehabilitation in Charlotte. It was the least they could do repay him for 1985. At the time, Perry was still in the intensive care unit at Aiken Regional Medical Centers, a virtual paraplegic. Doctors there said if not for his body strength, he probably wouldn't have survived. He had needed 20 liters of fluids in his first 36 hours of treatment because of severe dehydration, and had to have mucus sucked out of his throat and chest. \"He had a tube down him, and I could hear him calling my name,'' Valerie says of his hospital stay in Aiken. \"He wanted me to stop them from hurting him. He kept calling me,'Help me! Help me!' I mean, you can't help him. I just could hear him crying and howling and I couldn't do nothing for him.'' Perry also was hallucinating and suffering from memory loss. An old friend from Aiken and Clemson, Charlie Timmerman, came to visit, and the Fridge was convinced Charlie was Danny Ford, the old Clemson football coach. He kept asking Charlie when football practice was, and Charlie had to tell him it wasn't 1981. After a month's stay in Aiken, Perry was moved to Charlotte in May 2009. And when he arrived, no one could believe that this was William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry. His supervising physician in Charlotte, Dr. Vishwa S. Raj, was a huge football fan and honestly didn't recognize him. At the time, Perry was still dealing with renal failure, was dehydrated and had high levels of sodium in his body. His hands and feet were numb, his hearing and vision was erratic, and Raj diagnosed him with CIDP -- Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy. Essentially, the Guillain-Barre was back, worse than before. His first day at the Charlotte hospital, Michael Dean stood by his side. Members of the Perry family say they felt Valerie had enabled William more than helped him, and they wanted her away from him in North Panthers. \"I didn't even know where my husband was staying at down there,'' Valerie says. \"They were ready to knock me out of the picture, because they wanted to take over.... At first I got kind of upset; I had a feeling they were blaming me for it. But I wasn't worried about that. They already knew how much he drank before I met him. \"I mean, Michael was telling me,'He's got a lot of brain damage now because of the alcohol.' You see they always want to blame me and the alcohol. The man was drinking before I met him and they know how much he was drinking.'' Whether Valerie deserved blame or not -- and the Perry family says she didn't make an attempt to see her husband in Charlotte -- Michael and his sister Patsy, 12 years older than Fridge, were now in charge of his care. And the hospital needed them both. Those first 24 hours, William couldn't even turn in the bed and had to lie flat until someone could rotate him. Even with his weight up to 220 by then, no one could easily move him, and that first day, Michael Dean had to be the one to transfer him from the bed to a wheelchair to the bathroom. \"The only thing he could lift was his head,'' Michael Dean says. \"He looked like a skeleton. He had lost so much weight, his cheekbones were so defined and his neck was so small. He was in bad shape.'' The next day, Michael Dean was back at the hospital and pulled aside by Raj. They began reminiscing about the 1985 touchdown against the Packers; the Super Bowl Shuffle; the McDonald's commercials. \"We were talking about what an iconic figure William actually was to many people -- the public, the sports fans and the like,'' Raj says. \"We decided we were going to give him everything we could to get him back to that level.'' The game plan was to have Patsy move from Aiken to Charlotte to stay with William full time and have Michael Dean available for the heavy lifting. Raj and the therapists worked on Fridge's mind. From the beginning, for instance, he wouldn't wear his hearing aid. Raj would talk to him, and he would nod at everything the doctor said. \"What did I just say?'' Raj would ask. And the Fridge would give the wrong answer. \"Well, could you put your hearing aid on?'' the doctor would ask. \"I don't need it,'' Fridge would say. \"Just try,'' the doctor would say. Eventually, there were breakthroughs -- tiny ones -- but they added up. He began wearing the hearing aid, and with the help of therapists Joanna Edeker, Brittany Lorden and Chris Brown, he would start to get around. Whenever he would beg for a day off or an hour off, Raj or the therapists would bring up Ditka. That was their secret weapon. Perry had earlier told them that his nickname for his old coach was \"Slim.'' So on the days he wanted to quit, Raj or the therapists would ask, \"What would'Slim' say right now?'' \"Ah,'' Fridge would laugh. \"Slim would make me run another 50-yard dash right now.'' Eventually, the real breakthrough was aquatic therapy. Michael Dean would literally lift him into the pool, and his brother's legs began to respond. Life was creeping back into his gaunt face. He would ham it up during therapy sessions, and in a crowded gym one day, he recited every one of his lines from the Super Bowl Shuffle. You're lookin' at the Fridge I'm the rookie. I may be large, but I'm no dumb cookie... \"We dared him to do it,'' Raj says, \"and this was in a gym with plenty of patients who had illnesses, things that were pretty devastating. But he just went right into it, and when he did, everyone paid attention. I've never seen the gym be so electric with patients who were just worried about their recovery. He brought joy to everybody for one brief moment.\" For the first time in two years, he looked like Refrigerator Perry. He checked out of the hospital in early 2010 and moved into a Charlotte apartment with Patsy. He was an out-patient now, and although Patsy's job was to care for him and make certain he made it to therapy every day, her real job was to make certain he didn't drink. The Perry family felt William could walk all over Valerie, but they said Patsy was a mother figure, a tough one, who was unafraid to call him on his BS. He would make her believe that he was too sore to walk, but when she'd put a fresh batch of homemade cookies up in the cupboard, she'd spy him walking over and eating them. There was no pulling the wool over Patsy's eyes, and she was not about to let him drive to the liquor store for his beer and vodka. Finally, in September 2010, he asked if he could return to Aiken, and Raj gave him his blessing. It was an emotional goodbye for the entire staff, but also an encouraging one. Raj told him that exercise was crucial and that he had one other bit of advice. \"I told him, point blank, no alcohol,'' the doctor said. Perry seemed uncomfortable, didn't want to hear it. But Raj explained that given his functional deficits, the risk was too extreme. \"What's more important is him recovering and getting back to his old life, getting back to what he's known for, for being a wonderful personality in society,'' Raj says. \"And if even minimal alcohol use could stop that from happening.... Well, at least when he left the hospital, I think he accepted that he shouldn't do it.'' Perry wanted so badly to be back in Aiken, back with Valerie, and -- as husband and wife -- they intended to continue his rehab together. It was all up to her, considering Michael was back in Charlotte and considering William had chosen Valerie over Patsy. The rest of the Perry family preferred that Patsy continue to oversee his recovery, but whatever William's reasons were -- and some in the family say it's probably because Patsy ruled with an iron fist -- he chose to rehab with his wife. Valerie joined a gym; she says she had the best intentions. But by November 2010, all the bad habits, all the excuses and all of William's old demons were back. He was drinking beer again; not an excessive amount, but enough to manage his cravings. \"Yeah, I admit to myself, yeah, I'm an alcoholic,'' he says. \"It just keeps going, keeps going, keeps going and keeps going.'' Valerie says he drives to get the beer when she's not home or not looking, and even though he has his home gym and his home walking path, those drives to the liquor store are about his only exercise. It's not what Raj or Michael Dean or Patsy had in mind, but, now, not even Ditka and the'85 Bears can get him out of his rut. In November, the Bears organization staged its 25th anniversary reunion of the'85 team, and planned a raucous weekend in Bears. The Fridge didn't attend, and when asked why, he says, \"I didn't even know of the anniversary.'' The truth is, he did know about it and filmed a video message to be read at the event. But the mind of William Perry is going again, and no one knows where it'll end up. According to Michael Dean and Valerie, he's also been diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure, although Valerie rolls her eyes because she cannot get him to take his medication. \"What about your diabetes?'' a reporter asked him in late January. \"I don't think I have that disease.'' \"What about high blood pressure?'' \"I might, I might have that one. I say'might' because lately when I went to the doctor, he said my blood pressure is fine.'' \"Are you taking your blood pressure medicine?'' \"No, no.'' \"Are you supposed to be?'' \"Am I supposed to be taking my medicine? Yes, yes.'' \"Have you been?'' \"I take it sometimes, sometimes I don't. I mean, I'm not going to lie to you.'' \"Are you risking your life by not taking it?'' \"I don't think I'm risking my life by, you know, not taking my medicine all the time. Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't. It just slips my mind.'' Fridge's family members want Valerie to chop his medicine up and pour it into his food, want her to do something. She says she's trying. And they admit William is going to be William. He is stubborn; he is not the innocent Fridge from'85. He is not coachable. William Perry does what he wants. The unfinished home he lives in is cold. The heat doesn't work in all spaces of the cavernous house. He sits all day watching his TV, wearing Topsiders with no socks, sitting sometimes in his own urine. His family says he is incontinent; it's another one of his issues. But sometimes, it's just too difficult to stand up and simply walk to the bathroom. Ditka knows only bits and pieces of this, and he says the last time he spoke to the Fridge, he felt he understood that he couldn't drink, that this was \"his last chance.'' Perry doesn't believe he's putting himself in jeopardy, though. He looks in the mirror and he sees a body that now weighs 400 pounds. That's better than 190, he says. That's progress, he says. He still does occasional autograph signings in Bears, making a bit of cash here and there. He says he can't be in too bad of shape if he can climb onto a plane and write his name 100 times. He says he can't be too bad off if he can still recite lyrics to the \"Super Bowl Shuffle.\" He says he can't be too sick if he's down to only one or two beers a night. The gap in his teeth is gone. The gap between William Perry and reality has apparently taken its place.

Not from Eagles or Falcons or his hometown of Newport News, Va. He was getting the key to the city of Cowboys. As you know, Michael Vick returned to the NFL in 2009 after a league-mandated suspension stemming from a 23-month federal prison sentence for his involvement in an illegal dogfighting ring. He served 18 months in federal prison and time in home confinement, and was released from custody in July 2009. We all know the horrific tales of what Michael Vick and his friends did to those dogs. He has paid his legal debt to society and has been forgiven by some. And this is why Cowboys councilman and Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway entered the picture. Michael Vick was in town over the weekend to speak to at-risk kids about staying in school, avoiding drugs and treating animals right, especially dogs. It's the same speech Michael Vick has given at countless schools and recreation centers across the country. Caraway said Michael Vick's story is inspirational, one that kids will listen to. Caraway believes kids won't listen to people with suits and ties when it comes to avoiding trouble, but rather will take the advice of athletes, especially those who have dealt with adversity. \"The message and the kids are far greater than all this response about,'Why give him the key to the city?'\" Caraway told ESPN Cowboys on Monday afternoon. \"He is telling kids and exchanging with them the rights and wrongs of the things that he did and encouraging kids to further their education and to not deal with the drugs. To obey their parents and pick the people they hang around. That's a message I would challenge anybody to say that not one kid across America shouldn't hear from people in notoriety such as Michael Vick.\" Caraway is wrong for doing this. This is nothing against Michael Vick, who also was named The Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year the same day he received the key to the city. But this is about using people in the right way. This is not how you use Michael Vick. There were all sorts of athletes in town for the Super Bowl. I ran into Los Angeles Angels outfielder Torii Hunter at a party Saturday night. He would have been a good candidate to receive the key to the city. How about Cowboys native Spud Webb or another former NBA player such as Greg Anthony, currently a basketball commentator? What about local athletes? Felix Jones? DeMarcus Ware? Jason Witten? Michael Young (as long as he's still with us)? Miles Austin? Andre Gurode? Tyson Chandler? Guys who have bounced back from their own types of adversity, maybe not the ones Michael Vick returned from, but enough to say they have a good story to tell. Honor those guys. Caraway said Michael Vick's return from his problems is the primary reason for getting the key to the city, in conjunction with addressing the kids. Deion Sanders was in Lancaster, Texas, on Saturday with his Truth U foundation, coaching a youth football game against rapper Snoop Dogg. Sanders was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday. Maybe Sanders should get a key to the city. After all, he's also mentoring kids in Cowboys. Most pro athletes speak to kids. But they don't get the key to the city unless they've won some sort of championship. Michael Vick should be given all sorts of credit for rebuilding his image, but he shouldn't have received the key to the city. Cowboys Mayor Tom Leppert said in a statement that Caraway acted without his knowledge and that the action was not an official ceremonial honor on behalf of the city. The city awards two types of keys. The major one is handed out by the mayor, but a secondary one, such as the one Michael Vick received, could be given to anyone by any council member. Still, a recognition of Michael Vick by the city should have been avoided. He did the right thing by speaking to the kids. It's just that Caraway didn't need to give him an additional honor. \"It seems like a bunch of adults are ticked off about it, but tomorrow in America, these kids will be in charge,\" Caraway said. \"These kids need to hear things that are positive. So you take a negative and you turn it into a positive because instead of beating down on the man, instead of lifting him up, then what hopes will these children have?\" Nothing wrong with Michael Vick's message. Just the way in which he was recognized.

You have these little bumps and bruises. That ain't [expletive].\" Approximately 1,250 temporary seats at the $1.2 billion stadium were not completely installed and were declared unusable hours before the Packers' win over the Steelers. The NFL moved 850 fans to similar or better seats, taking tickets away from several league and Cowboys employees to make room. An estimated 400 fans who had tickets with a face value of $800 did not get seats in the stadium. Those fans were given the option of watching the game while standing on a platform or viewing it on television while sitting in a club behind the Steelers' bench. The fans were given three times the face value of their tickets and allowed to go on the field after the game. Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday those fans would be \"guests of the NFL\" at Super Bowl XLVI in Colts next year. \"Manpower and timing issues caused inconveniences to some fans,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in a statement. \"At the end of the preparations, approximately 400 fans attending the game were not able to watch from those installed seats. We deeply regret their Super Bowl experience was impacted by this error, and we share that responsibility with the NFL.\" Goodell said earlier in the day that the problems with the seats were \"obviously a failure on our behalf,\" adding that the league takes the responsibility. As far as Cuban is concerned, neither the league nor the Cowboys are to blame. He pointed at the vendors contracted to install the seats as the problem. \"It's not like Jerry Jones is going to be able to go up there and set the seats up himself,'' Cuban said. \"So you work with vendors and you trust them, and sometimes they come through and sometimes they don't. \"And when they don't, they're not the ones that are going to look bad. In that case, Jerry and the NFL looks bad. But I wouldn't put it on Jerry or the NFL.'' Cuban partnered with Jones to bring the NBA All-Star Game to Cowboys Stadium last year. A crowd of 108,713 watched that game, shattering the record for attendance at a basketball game. As is the case with the Super Bowl, Cuban is extremely confident that Cowboys Stadium will be in the regular rotation for NBA All-Star Games. \"It just makes too much sense,\" Cuban said. \"It's enclosed, it's beautiful and it's got all the suites. It's an opportunity for everybody to do business and for the fans to have fun.\" There is one thing that Cuban said he would have done differently than the NFL and Jones given the circumstances on Super Bowl Sunday. \"I would have called suite holders and said,'Hey, here's what the problem is, would you do me a favor?'\" said Cuban, a Steelers native who watched the game from a luxury suite. \"And I'm sure many of us would have. \"We had a couple of extra seats that a couple of people could have stayed in my suite if they were Steeler fans.\" Tim MacMahon covers the Cowboys and Mavericks for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=6100568", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Packers", "Steelers", "Colts"]}, {"title": "Superb Owl: Football as America", "author": "Jeff MacGregor", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "Declaration of Independence. \"America the Beautiful.\" Bad anthem. Good game. Bad commercials. Weird night. I admit to having watched it wrong. No one is supposed to pay 100 percent attention to the Super Bowl. You're not meant to stare at it. You're not meant to derive meaning from it. You're supposed to be in and out of the room, Facebooking, Tweeting, basting those honey/jalapeno wings and distracted by complaints about the bean dip and your brother-in-law's running commentary on the state of television body models. I just sat and stared. Sorry. Thus our annual spasm of national excess came and went and knocked me flat, because what I saw being sold Sunday night was not football in America but football as America. Borrowing NASCAR's marketing playbook, the NFL is now peddling 200-proof patriotism. This not only on the eve of a probable lockout of Labor by Capital, but on Ronald Reagan's centennial, on the very day of that great union buster's double jubilee. Which may somehow account for the presence of former Secretary of State Colin Powell at the game to introduce a seriatim reading of the Declaration of Independence by NFL personnel. Let that sink in. This absurd bit of recurring corporate performance art was staged at around 5:55 p.m. Eastern this year, in case you missed it. If so, maybe there's a commemorative DVD in the pipeline. We can only hope. Last seen selling the United Nations an elaborate and unfounded promise of weapons of mass destruction, the self-made general was this time seen next to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the self-made senator's son who pulled himself up by his loafer tassels to his present position of absolute authority. To sell us just exactly what, I'm not entirely sure. But the implication? Two generals side by side. Their message? Freedom is good. At least in moderation. Too much freedom is apt to result in a 15-yard, 15-grand penalty for excessive celebration, after all. Besides, conventional wisdom knows that NFL football doesn't teach freedom, it teaches teamwork. But even that's not true. The NFL teaches conformity. Teamwork you learn playing peewee ball. In the NFL you learn to keep your socks up and your head down and your mouth shut so as not to impede the steady flow of revenue. Which may be why we stopped seeing that single finger salute to solidarity so early in the season. Apt, then, that on the heels of all this freedom-mongering and patriotic Dada, we get a botched anthem from Christina Aguilera. Then 90-plus minutes of football and commerce. Then halftime. Black Eyed Peas. During which you received 279 very funny Tweets from your friends (\"They're like future crime fighters in outer space!\"), and of which pro-democracy Egyptians on Liberation Square were heard to say, \"If the box-head robot run amok of pop-and-lock is where freedom leads, then thank you Mr. George Redskins, but no thank you.\" Then back to football. And that Chrysler commercial everyone's talking about today. The strangeness of the spot being that it shifts blame while sentimentalizing failure. As if a series of things had happened to Lions over which Lions had no control. As if terrible design and low build-quality and 19 layers of overlapping vice presidents outlobbying the EPA from 1970 to 2000 were unavoidable natural disasters. How about choosing instead to produce cars people actually wanted to buy? Or making cars that didn't fall apart, cars that outlasted their new car smell? Instead of a Hallmark card indicting Fate, how about a nice thank-you note to the rest of us for the repeated bailouts, and a workable design for a high-quality, high-mileage family sedan? And note, please, the pivotal imagery of those autoworkers hard at it. The vigor of those forms. Because the very people who would gladly dismantle Organized Labor all together are always willing to appropriate the Technicolor detail of happy, muscular labor when trying to sell the story of our own lives back to us. As is the NFL. Thus revealing this year's Super Bowl theme: Work hard. Don't worry about freedom. Trust the bosses. They'll take care of you. Honest. If this year's edition of our professional football championship is predictive, 25 years from now Super Sunday will be the most sacred holiday on the American calendar. July 4th will be forgotten, as will Memorial Day and Labor Day and Election Day. We will simply appoint former players to the Hall of Fame and high office in the same ceremony. And now, to honor America, please rise and greet your next president, Mr. Ben Roethlisberger! There was a time not long ago -- back before Sept. 11, 2001 -- when Americans were more suspicious of patriotic tripe like this. More skeptical. We knew we were being sold to. Manipulated. We were wary of the bunting and the fireworks, the martial music and the orotund speeches and the free beer and lemonade. We were cautious in the face of all those easy promises, because even worse than having the wool pulled over our eyes was having the flag pulled over them. This is no longer the case. Now freedom insists on our willingness to be suckered, to be gulled by the demagogues and swindled by the interests. To be hoodwinked. Bamboozled. To pay 10 bucks for a beer. That trained eagle they release just before kickoff? The one that flies a few feet, circles, then returns to the comfort and safety of his cage? He flies for us all. Good game, though.

In the middle of last week, the NFL had an idea that the 1,250 seats would not be ready in time for kickoff between Packers and Steelers, but wanted to wait and see if it could complete a Hail Mary. Add in the troubles many fans had getting into the stadium and Sunday was not the sparkling Super Bowl debut many hoped to have. A near-record crowd of 103,219 watched the Packers beat Steelers 31-25, but the gaffes that arose Sunday after a week of wretched weather put a damper on much of the local celebration. \"The attendance record was not the goal,\" NFL executive vice president Eric Grubman said. \"The goal was to use this great building in a way that showcased the NFL, showcased North Texas and showcased some great players that we have in the NFL. And if we can come up with a better installation plan for a future event, we'll do that.\" The goal of Super Bowl XLV from Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, to the North Texas Super Bowl Host Committee and officials from all across the region was to be part of some sort of unofficial Super Bowl rotation. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who does not have a vote in the process, said the game could return. Patriots's Robert Kraft and Redskins's Daniel Snyder endorsed a return last week before the game was played. \"It's a membership vote, but I think they did an outstanding job,\" Goodell said. \"It was a great event, and I'm sure that they'll be seeking another Super Bowl and I'm sure the ownership will look at that very seriously.\" At his Cowboys office Monday morning, host committee CEO and president Bill Lively noticed the sun and blue skies outside his window, perhaps wondering where that weather had been for most of last week. \"We're saddened by some of the ticket issues and some of the lines, but that is not what we do,\" Lively said. \"We are affected by it because we care about it.\" The NFL runs the game, while the host committee is responsible for the lead-up. Lively said the Super Bowl breakfast had the largest attendance in the history of the game. The Taste of the NFL for the first time will deliver more than $1 million to food banks nationwide. The Gala drew more than 3,000, which also was a record. \"So many big things happened and were celebrated in spite of all the crazy weather, that's my memory,\" Lively said. \"The committee kept its commitments and did what it said. The game was a great game. The stadium looked great. \"The problems there are not insignificant problems, but I have to believe this: The stadium hosted the game so effectively, the revenue generation had to be tremendous for the owners. The television coverage I'm sure was very good. I'm sure the ratings will turn out to be good ratings that it's going to have a bearing on when the game comes back.\" Goodell said preliminary ratings indicate the game will be the most-watched show in the history of television. For the host committee, the next few months will be about filing reports of what worked well and what needs to be improved, an audit, liquidation of equipment and the dismantling of a staff that worked four years to put the game on. In June, Lively will move over to his role as president of the Cowboys Symphony Orchestra. He and Roger Staubach, who was the chairman of the host committee, promised to work one Super Bowl. It is possible Troy Aikman could take over in Staubach's role as the leader for a future Super Bowl. \"I went around the corridors of the stadium, talking to everyone,'Where you from?'\" Lively said. \"I did it before the game, and I did it after the game. I think I counted people from 19 nations and I found people from all over the country, not just Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \"They didn't know who I was. I took my badge off and stuffed it inside my coat. I asked them,'How did you find the experience?' And to the person it was,'The hospitality has been superb. It's been great.' \"Some complained of the lines and the cold of last week, but the pervasive answer was,'This has been fun. This stadium is just gangbusters.' And it is. So the NFL will benefit from this and we'll learn from our host committee model and do it better the next time.\" Todd Archer covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/columns/story?columnist=archer_todd&id=6099186", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Packers", "Steelers", "Patriots", "Redskins"]}, {"title": "NFL in L.A.? Some guesses, answers", "author": "Arash Markazi", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "After a press conference to announce the naming rights deal for Farmers Field earlier in the week, it seemed the NFL was ready to officially announce it was coming back to Los Angeles the next day. Well, not quite. Construction on the stadium is still at least a year away, and it could be even longer before an NFL team actually relocates to Los Angeles. So when will Los Angeles finally get the NFL back? Here is the answer (or at least our best guess) to that question and others seen and heard in the past few days: How significant was the Farmers Insurance naming rights deal in making the downtown stadium a reality? It was significant from the standpoint that it helps to solve the financing problem, which has been the single biggest problem Los Angeles developers have encountered in getting a football stadium privately financed with no public funding. The most important thing in financing a project as big as this is \"contractually obligated income.\" The first question any bank has for any developer wanting to engage in a $1 billion private investment is how they plan on making that investment pay off. If they can prove that, at the very least, the cost of the stadium will be paid off by a naming rights deal over 30 years before a single event is even held, well, getting that loan becomes easier. Is it true the naming rights deal will be more if a second NFL team plays in the stadium? Yes. The current naming rights deal is for $700 million over 30 years with the understanding it will be the home of one NFL team and potentially host an average of three Super Bowls and two Final Fours every 10 years. The deal would increase to $1 billion if the stadium becomes the home of more than one NFL team. Considering AEG is projecting the cost of the stadium to be $1 billion, there is now more of a financial incentive to attract two NFL teams to Los Angeles. Not only would they have the contractually obligated income to completely finance the stadium, but it would also guarantee 10 more NFL games per year, which, again, would help toward that contractually obligated income annually. Which teams are the likeliest to move to Los Angeles? The teams that always come up when there's talk of relocation are the Chargers, Jaguars, Vikings, Rams, Bills, Raiders and 49ers. The one that makes the most sense currently is the Chargers, and if there's a second team Los Angeles could very well see the return of the Rams. Chargers owner Alex Spanos has been trying to sell a stake in his team, and it's looking more and more unlikely that the team will ever get the new stadium it covets. They've been trying for almost a decade and are probably no closer to getting a new home today than they were when they began this process in 2002. The Chargers can announce their intentions to leave Chargers between Feb. 1 and April 30 of each year through 2020 if they pay off the bonds used to expand Qualcomm Stadium in 1997, which currently would be about $26 million. So if it doesn't look like the Chargers will get a new stadium in downtown Chargers (and it doesn't look good at the moment), look for them to announce their intention to move to Los Angeles -- which was their first home when they were founded in 1960 -- sometime after Feb. 1, 2012. The Rams make the most sense to be the second team to call Farmers Field their home, because the Rams' lease agreement with the Rams Convention & Visitors Commission states that the Edward Jones Dome must rank among the top-eight stadiums in the NFL by 2015. If it doesn't, the Rams have the option of getting out of their lease and leaving Rams. Edward Jones Dome will be one of the older stadiums in the league by 2015, and the chances of it getting the necessary improvements to become a top-tier facility are almost as remote as the Chargers getting a new stadium. Considering Farmers Field plans to open its doors in 2015, the timing couldn't be better for the Rams to move back to Los Angeles after a 20-year absence. Having the Chargers and the Rams relocate to Los Angeles would be the most ideal scenario for the league, which would like to see one AFC West team and one NFC West team move to Los Angeles (preferably with Los Angeles ties) so the geography of the current divisions still work and each of the conference's television broadcasters (currently CBS and FOX) will get a team in the country's second-biggest media market. What kind of timeline are we looking at here in terms of getting a team and starting construction on the stadium? Well, if you're looking for a general date for everything to start coming together, look toward April 2012. If AEG picks an architect this month to begin the actual blue prints and floor plans for the stadium, it will take 6-8 months to complete that process. After that AEG will bid the project out, so it will be at least a year before construction can actually begin. During that time, AEG must complete the entitlement process and the environmental impact reports. It must also get the blessing of the city to issue $350 million worth of bonds that they promise to pay off with a stadium-ticket tax and backstop so it will not cost taxpayers anything. This is assuming the league and the players union comes to an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement in time to play the 2011 season. If AEG can get all that done and begin construction in early April 2012, the Chargers would likely get out of their lease in Chargers (they have until April 30), announce their intention to move to Los Angeles and play at the Coliseum, their first home in 1960, for a couple years until Farmers Field is built. In late May 2012, the NFL will announce the site of the 50th Super Bowl. AEG has said it wants the game to be held at Farmers Field, but unless construction has begun on the stadium and the venue has a commitment to house an NFL team by the time the announcement is made it's going to be hard for the league to award Farmers Field the game on speculation. We've seen a few pictures of Farmers Field; is that really how it's going to look? No. The drawings you've seen so far are simply schematics to give you a feel for what the stadium could look like, but AEG hasn't settled on an architect yet. It will select one this month, and all indications are it will choose the Gensler firm, which designed L.A. Live and drew up the current renderings of Farmers Field. The international architecture firm is moving its regional headquarters to downtown Los Angeles, after operating for 20 years in Santa Monica, Calif. The actual stadium could look a lot more like a retractable-roofed version of Allianz Arena in Munch, Germany, which was the FIFA World Cup Stadium in 2006. Tim Leiweke, AEG president and CEO, has mentioned how much he likes the look of the stadium with its changing exterior colors. Isn't 64,000 seats small for a stadium wanting to host Super Bowls and Final Fours and be in contention to host future World Cups and Olympics? Not really. Farmers Field would hold about 64,000 for NFL games but would expand to 78,000 for Super Bowls, Final Fours and other big events such as the World Cup and Olympics. While Angelenos are used to large stadiums such as the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl, which can seat close to 100,000 fans, the fact is more than half the stadiums in the NFL seat less than 70,000. Thanks to NFL blackout rules, which state a game must be sold out 72 hours before kickoff to be shown locally, most teams prefer having a smaller total attendance but a higher gross gate through an increased number of luxury suites and club seats. There is no magic number to the 78,000-seating capacity when attempting to host Super Bowls and Final Fours. In fact, 78,000 would make Farmers Field one of the larger venues to be in the rotation for those big events. All but two Super Bowls since 1987 have had an attendance figure smaller than 76,500, and the largest turnout ever for the Final Four was 72,922 at Lions's Ford Field in 2009. We keep hearing how the stadium is going to help the convention and tourism business in Los Angeles; how does a football stadium do that? Farmers Field will be connected to the Los Angeles Convention Center and serve as an extension to the convention center when it isn't holding an event. This is the reason the football stadium is actually being called an \"event center\" and why it will have a retractable roof. Mark Liberman, president of convention and visitors bureau L.A. Inc., has said Los Angeles struggles to book large, profitable conventions because it has two separate, disconnected halls. The plan for Farmers Field is to add 90,000 square feet to the already remodeled South Hall, demolish the old disconnected West Hall and build the stadium on that site, which would give the total new event center 1.7 million square feet. The increased continuous flat and unobstructed exhibition space would move Los Angeles from number 15 in U.S. convention centers to number 5. Pouria Abbassi, general manager of the Los Angeles Convention Center, believes the venue is in dire need of upgrades or it is \"going to be out of business in the next 10 years.\" He said 93 percent of competitive venues worldwide have seen major renovations in the past 15 years, and during that time Los Angeles has fallen way behind in the convention business. The consensus is the aging West Hall needs to be replaced one way or another, and since there is no public funding available to do this AEG's privately financed proposal is an attractive offer. This is one the biggest reasons why the plan is being championed by local politicians who might otherwise be skeptical of building a football-only stadium in downtown Los Angeles. Whatever happened to that NFL stadium proposal in the City of Industry? Isn't Ed Roski trying to build a football stadium in Las Vegas now? The City of Industry is still very much in the mix. In fact, for all the pomp and pageantry of Tuesday's Farmers Field press conference, Industry is still the only stadium proposal in the area that is \"shovel ready\" after completing the entitlement process and getting two approved environmental impact reports. The problem is Industry has been ready to start construction on its stadium for three years now and is seemingly no closer to attracting a team today than it was when it first started. While it is true billionaire developer Roski, who has spent $17 million over the past three years on the Industry project, is now attempting to build a football stadium/events center on the campus of UNLV, a Majestic Realty representative said it has no impact on the current plans to build a football stadium in Industry.

Or he'd hit you with, \"Damn, when'd they let you out?\" The prison-release greeting always caused Def Comedy-type laughter. Or this classic from last year: \"I sang the State Farm agent song. How'd your unemployed [butt] pop up here?\" Sometimes, he'd ask people at the door who they were rooting for. If they answered with the team he didn't want to win, he wouldn't let them in. For the last 20-some-odd years (no one officially kept count), my god-brother Andre Curry hosted the annual Super Bowl party that was our crew's one-day football holiday -- the day we looked forward to like our kids looked forward to the sun coming up on Dec. 25. His Super Bowl parties were our Christmas, complete with laughter, liquor, the game on in two different rooms, and a'hood-famous secret-recipe homemade goulash that was always gone by the end of the first quarter. Sunday was another one of those legendary affairs. But this time, for the first time, Big Dre wasn't there. He unexpectedly passed away in May. Congestive heart failure. SB XLV was our first Super Bowl without him. But in his honor, the party went on. For just about everyone in our collective, it was one of those \"looking forward to/ not looking forward to\" kind of occasions. As much as each of us was into seeing the Packers and the Steelers battle, we all knew that the game would probably take a backseat to the one person who wasn't there. Dre, a high school football coach, was our football guy; the football guy in the clique. He lived for these Sundays. Which is why he chose every year to play host for the last game of the NFL season. Now that he's gone, Dre's cousin, Mickey Pruitt, inherited the tradition, one that every member of our crew knew had to be kept alive. Mickey is a former NFL player, former champion with the Cowboys. (All in good fun, he brought out the replica SB trophy he got as a member of the Cowboys to remind us.) This party might have meant as much to him as SB XXVII, the one in which he played. As Sunday's game went on, Dre's absence became more obvious, his presence more missed. Although his words, his jokes and even his obnoxious ability to be right about 90 percent of our meaningful historical Super Bowl stats questions weren't there, everything else remained the same. Raul -- we call him \"Ru\" -- still placed bets on everything imaginable, including yards gained on second downs. Maurice (\"Mo\") still argued loud enough to make everyone think the next people to ring the doorbell would be the cops. And Andre's 17-year old son Brandon -- who was always a part of our Super Bowl activities even when he was too young to watch the game with us -- helped keep the tradition intact by making his father's goulash for the first time in his life. Like father, like half-grown son. At halftime, a ceremonial toast. Shots chased by extra shots. Dre would have expected nothing less. I was prepared for a sad Super Bowl, but it turned into one of joy. For all of us. This collection of friends, who grew up together or grew on one another and used football as an excuse to get together and act the fools for one day a year, has turned into something much, much more. Now the party is liturgical. From an annual affair to a ritual. One that the man who put us all together in the first place would be proud of if he were still with us. \"He still is,\" my man Luke assured me as we watched that championship belt get draped across Aaron Rogers' shoulder. Big Dre still was. For Father's Day last year, we all had black rubber wrist bracelets made in Andre's honor. On them, along with his name (\"Dre\") and dates (\"1962-2010\") are the three words that best tell the story of his life: \"Live. Love. Laugh.\" Which is what we all did during this first Super Bowl without him. Again, he would have expected nothing less. Scoop Jackson is a columnist for ESPN.com. MORE COMMENTARY \u00bb", "link": "https://www.espn.com/espn/commentary/news/story?page=jackson/110208", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Cowboys"]}, {"title": "LA stadium panel questioned", "author": null, "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- The seasoned local business leaders picked by the mayor to analyze plans for a downtown NFL stadium on the public's behalf seem to have one thing in common: deep financial, political and civic ties with the company promoting the venue. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa' s panel includes a former governor who received generous donations from entities connected to the owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group; entertainment executives that have partnered with the firm or its affiliates; and business owners who have served alongside company president and CEO Tim Leiweke on local civic boards and commissions. That makeup could cast doubt on its ability to objectively evaluate the stadium project that may involve financial risk for the cash-strapped city, said Robert Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. AEG's plan calls for the city to issue $350 million in bonds to relocate a huge convention center structure where the 64,000-seat stadium would be built, although the company has promised to service that debt and pay anticipated shortfalls. City officials must also approve AEG's lease for space on the city-owned convention center property. AEG has also sworn it will pick up the entire $1 billion tab for the stadium itself. \"The question is: Is this commission designed to watch out for taxpayers, or is it designed to make sure the stadium gets built?\" Stern said. The plan is one of two competing proposals that aim to bring football back to Los Angeles some 15 years after the Rams and Raiders left the nation's second-largest market. Warehouse magnate Ed Roski has permits in place to build a separate 75,000-seat stadium about 15 miles east of Los Angeles, in the city of Industry. Both camps have said they hope to recruit a team -- and possibly two -- from among those in the league that need a new stadium to maximize revenue but are unable to get one built in their current locations. Villaraigosa announced his unpaid Blue Ribbon Commission on the planned venue last week at a lavish promotional event timed to the disclosure of a naming-rights deal with Farmers Insurance Exchange worth at least $700 million -- if a team can be lured to the city. The mayor, an enthusiastic supporter of the downtown proposal, promised that the commission would help ensure that the plan puts taxpayers' interests first. But a look at the commission members' backgrounds could raise concerns over its independence. The members include: \u2022 Gray Davis, former governor of California. AEG owner Philip Anschutz and his affiliated companies contributed more than $93,000 leading up to Davis' successful re-election campaign in 2002, according to a tally of campaign filings by Berkeley-based MAPLight.org, which tracks political donations. The entities also contributed $50,000 in opposition to the 2003 gubernatorial recall that cost Davis the governorship and resulted in the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u2022 Michael Lynton, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, who serves as the panel's co-chairman. Sony Pictures paid $60 million to AEG's concert promotion business, AEG Live, and the Michael Jackson estate for footage of the late pop star's rehearsals that were later released as the $252-million-grossing documentary \"This Is It.\" Sony and AEG collaborated on the production of the film, which premiered during a heavily promoted October 2009 event at the AEG-owned LA Live hotel and entertainment complex near the site of the planned NFL stadium. \u2022 Richard Nanula, principal at Colony Capital LLC. Colony, who helped pair Jackson with AEG for the pop star's planned comeback tour as part of a deal that involved the fund's purchase of a $24 million mortgage on Neverland Ranch just before a foreclosure auction was scheduled. Colony is also the former owner of New Jersey's Meadowlands retail and entertainment complex, where AEG plans to build a new concert venue. \u2022 Sherry Lansing, former chairwoman and CEO of Paramount Pictures. Lansing ran Paramount in 2001, when Anschutz's production company, Crusader Entertainment, signed a three-year financing and distribution deal with her studio. The collaboration produced the film \"Sahara.\" \u2022 Bert Boeckman, president and owner of the North Hills-based Galpin Motors auto dealership. Boeckman sat alongside Leiweke on former Mayor James Hahn's Council of Economic Advisers. \u2022 Andrew J.C. Cherng, founder and chairman of Panda Restaurant Group Inc. Cherng served with Leiweke on Villaraigosa' s delegation to the U.S. Olympic Committee in 2006, when the city was seeking to host the 2016 games. The remaining members -- panel co-chair Austen Beutner, who is the city's deputy mayor and economic policy chief, and Mark Attanasio, managing partner of the investment firm Crescent Capital Group LP -- have no clear ties to the company. Davis said he was approaching the stadium project with skepticism -- especially over whether it could be built without public money -- and that the cynicism won't be eroded by the donations he received from AEG. \"The fact that people who may have an interest in this contributed to me six or seven years ago is not going to influence my decision on whether or not this is a good deal for the people of Los Angeles,\" he said. Lansing, now a philanthropist whose nonprofit organization focuses on cancer research and public education, said there was no reason for anyone to be concerned about her independence because she's never had a relationship with Anschutz or his companies that would make her biased. \"I had very limited contact with Mr. Anschutz during the time that Paramount made'Sahara' and have not had any contact with him since that I remember,\" she said. Boeckman said he has no ongoing relationship with Leiweke. But if he did, he added, it would not influence his thinking on the stadium. \"To me it's important to do the right thing,\" he said. A message left for Cherng was not returned. AEG spokesman Michael Roth declined to comment, as did Nanula. Sony Pictures spokesman Jim Kennedy referred questions to the mayor's office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Political science professor Raphael Sonenshein, of the California State University, Fullerton, said AEG has become such a dominant force over the 13 years since it developed downtown's Staples Center that it might be impossible to find any business leaders who haven't worked with the company or its executives. \"AEG is so enmeshed now in Los Angeles and Sacramento that it would be really difficult to find any people that don't have a conflict of interest,\" he said. But Arnold Steinberg, a political strategist who previously advised former Mayor Richard Riordan, said the panel seemed to be an attempt by Villaraigosa' s administration to give itself political cover if the deal turns out to be a bad one for taxpayers. \"They're looking to pass the responsibility on to a group to suggest that somehow, this group of businesspeople will serve a fiduciary responsibility,\" he said. \"It's to pass the buck on decision-making and give the appearance of fairness and objectivity.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nfl/news/story?id=6102043", "Entities": ["Rams", "Raiders"]}, {"title": "Jon Bon Jovi clarifies Falcons interest", "author": "Chris Mortensen", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "Don't doubt New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi's love of football. He wants on the NFL stage and not as a performing artist. When Bon Jovi appeared on the field before the divisional round playoff game between the Falcons and eventual Super Bowl champion Packers, he was wearing the Falcons' red-and-black colors. Thus, the discussions and negotiations between the Falcons and Bon Jovi on a 15 percent minority ownership stake certainly bring more clarity to his appearance at the Jan. 15 game. Bon Jovi on Tuesday reinforced a clearly stated desire to be a member of NFL ownership. \"Since helping to establish the Eagles Soul Arena Football team -- from its inception through our 2008 championship season -- I have always made clear my desire to someday enter the NFL,\" Bon Jovi said through spokesperson Tiffany Shipp. Bon Jovi further confirmed an ESPN.com report that he has been in confidential negotiations after being approached by the Falcons \"some months ago.\" However, Bon Jovi concurred with Falcons owner Arthur Blank that talks have stalled or possibly awaiting a decision, though it doesn't diminish his passion to join the NFL ownership club. League sources say that Bon Jovi's proposed investment of as much as a 15 percentage stake and $150 million is not to be dismissed. \"For someone of Jon Bon Jovi\u0092's stature, this is more a matter of lifestyle than economics,\" said Marc Ganis, a Bears-based professional league sports consultant on stadiums and other finances. \"Bon Jovi loves sports and he clearly loves football and the NFL. He clearly has earned enough money in music and has royalties coming in where he doesn\u0092't have to work another day if he so pleased. But it's an opportunity to park some money in a place that brings him joy, in this case the NFL. He won\u0092't generate any returns on that money until there'\u0092s a sale, so he builds equity financially and he'\u0092s certainly not going to lose money. \"But I think the bigger deal for Bon Jovi is he gets to be part of a special club, maybe not as a majority owner but the [15 percent] stake is significant money. Would it be cool for him to sit around an NFL draft meeting or enjoy access others only dream of? Absolutely. Is it a first-step opportunity that could grow into something more significant? Maybe.\" Blank and other owners across the NFL have been aggressively seeking minority-stake investors. The reason is simple, according to Ganis. \"The lending institution -- the banks -- used to lend money regularly to these NFL teams without what you might interpret real assets, as opposed to [a projected valuation],\" Ganis said. \"An owner has to use something other than the team to secure a significant loan -- he has to use real assets and get a reasonable return. A lot has changed in the last three years. A 15 percent investment may not sound like a lot but it is a pretty tangible amount for a bank to measure when considering a loan.\" Chris Mortensen is ESPN's senior NFL analyst.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6102044", "Entities": ["Falcons", "Packers", "Eagles", "Bears"]}, {"title": "Test Story", "author": null, "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "NEW YORK -- For the second year in a row, the Super Bowl has set a record for American television viewing. The Nielsen Co. said Monday that an estimated 111 million people watched the Packers outlast the Steelers in professional football's ultimate game. That tops the 106.5 million who watched the 2010 game between Saints and Colts. The series finale of \"M-A-S-H\" had held the title of the most-watched TV show in the United States for 27 years. It is now number 3. Fox had the advantage of a game between two of the National Football League's iconic franchises and, even though it looked like it could be a rout when the Packers took a 21-3 lead, it went down to the final minute and held viewers' interest. In fact, the most-watched single play of the game was Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's final incomplete pass to Mike Wallace with about a minute to go, according to measurements by TiVo Inc., the digital video recorder maker. When that pass hit the ground, it clinched the game for Packers. The five most-watched events in U.S. TV history are now \"M-A-S-H\" (seen by just under 106 million people on Feb. 28, 1983) and the last four Super Bowls, Nielsen said. Television ratings in general have been super for the NFL this year, with viewership up 13 percent over last year, Nielsen said. Games on CBS, Fox and NBC averaged 20 million viewers, more than twice what networks get for their prime-time programming. \"Super Bowl XLV caps what is arguably the most successful season that any sports league has ever had,\" said Pat McDonough, senior vice president for insight and analysis at the Nielsen Co. \"The number of people watching NFL games has never been higher, with 24 percent more people watching the average NFL game this year than just five years ago. The Super Bowl continues to be in a category of its own.\" Football has become the communal event that television, in a splintered competitive world of dozens of networks, rarely provides outside of \"American Idol\" or the Oscars. Compelling story lines for the games and the growth in high-definition television help make the games compelling for viewers. The games also tend to be DVR-proof, with viewers wanting to see them live. Traditions that have built around the game itself make the Super Bowl compelling to non-sports fans. Christina Aguilera's goof on the National Anthem, the Black Eyed Peas halftime show and the dozens of commercials that companies debut on TV's biggest stage were water-cooler discussion topics along with the game on Monday. Fox's \"Glee\" took advantage of the time slot directly after the game, reaching 26.8 million viewers for its special episode. It was the most-watched scripted entertainment program on TV since Fox's \"House\" aired after the Super Bowl three years ago, Nielsen said. TiVo also judged the Snickers commercial featuring Richard Lewis and Roseanne Barr to be the top-rated commercial of the telecast. The company determines that through a calculation that takes in viewership and how many times people rewind their DVRs to watch the ad. Second place was Best Buy's ad with Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne. \"Funny ads made it to the top,\" said Tara Maitra, TiVo's vice president and general manager for audience research and advertising sales. The Black Eyed Peas' halftime show, with guests Usher and Slash, held its own. TiVo said it had nearly identical viewer engagement numbers as shows with classic rockers over the past two years. People were much less likely to stop the game to repeat the ads in the second half, when the football action was compelling, Maitra said. No beer ads made TiVo's top 10 rated ads for the game. The average Super Bowl viewer with a DVR either paused, rewound or fast-forwarded 145 times during the game, TiVo said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6102019", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Saints", "Colts", "Ben Roethlisberger", "Mike Wallace"]}, {"title": "Titans fire Mike Heimerdinger", "author": null, "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Titans coach Mike Munchak has fired offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger along with two other assistants as he starts to remake his coaching staff a day after taking over the top job.

The Titans released a statement a couple hours later that Mike Munchak also told defensive assistant Rayna Stewart and offensive assistant Richie Wessman that they will not be retained. \"It's never easy to be fired,\" Heimerdinger said. \"He has to do what's good for the Titans, and Munch will do what's best for the Titans.

Senior executive vice president Steve Underwood said in the team's statement that the Titans immediately offered to extend Heimerdinger's contract when he diagnosed. Heimerdinger was under contract for 2011. \"We will honor Mike's existing agreement with our club and continue to wish him a complete recovery,\" Underwood. This now gives Mike Munchak eight openings to fill on his coaching staff. Jeff Fisher had fired defensive coordinator Chuck Cecil last month, while the defensive line coach, running backs coach and wide receivers assistant all left for other jobs. Former teammate Bruce Matthews, now an assistant in Texans, is expected to be Mike Munchak's top target to fill his old job with the offensive line. The news brought almost instant reaction Tuesday. Titans safety Michael Griffin wrote on Twitter that, \"People thought it was a joke when I said no one is safe.\" This was Heimerdinger's second stint as offensive coordinator with Titans. He helped Steve McNair earn co-MVP of the NFL honors in 2003 and was part of three playoff teams in his first five seasons before leaving for the same job with the Jets in 2005. Jeff Fisher brought him back in 2008 after two seasons in Broncos. The Titans set a franchise-low with 12 sacks allowed in his first season back.The Titans racked up the second-most yards rushing in franchise history in 2009 when Chris Johnson set the NFL record for yards from scrimmage with 2,509 while earning the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. Heimerdinger kept coaching and didn't miss a game after being diagnosed with a rare cancer the day before Thanksgiving. Jeff Fisher extended his coordinator's contract before the season ended, and Heimerdinger said Tuesday his health played no role in the decision with his prognosis good even with two rounds of treatment remaining. \"This is strictly Munch thinks this is best for the Titans,\" Heimerdinger said. The Titans' offense struggled in 2010, ranking 27th in the NFL in total yards per game (302.1) and 25th in yards passing (194.2). Chris Johnson couldn't help the rushing attack much with just 107.9 yards averaged per game (17th overall). Worst, the Titans rank last in time of possession, holding the ball just 25 minutes, 54 seconds per game. Titans was limited by injuries at quarterback, including the season-ending thumb injury to Vince Young on Nov. 21. Asked about his offensive philosophy Monday, Mike Munchak said the Titans have to stay on the field no matter what they do on offense. \"We struggled last year to stay on the field as an offense. I'm stating the obvious. But we need to find a way, whatever that offense is, whatever that system is, we have to make first downs and stay out there,\" Mike Munchak said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6101875", "Entities": ["Titans", "Mike Munchak", "Jeff Fisher", "Texans", "Michael Griffin", "Jets", "Broncos", "Chris Johnson", "Vince Young"]}, {"title": "Athletes see ups, downs of social media", "author": "Elizabeth Merrill", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "DALLAS -- This whole mess started with a cell phone and a couple of bruised egos, and spiraled into a statewide panic. Forget 140 characters or less. This one began with two characters, with the bluster and force of a weeklong hurricane, and ended with a smiley face. There are some days when social media can spoil a man's peace. Rob Demovsky has been covering the Packers for the Packers Press Gazette for 14 years, and he's written about Brett Favre waffling and a community living and dying over its football team. He was settling into his seat on what was supposed to be a quiet Tuesday -- well, as quiet as it gets when the home team has just made it to the Super Bowl -- and had plans that night to spend quality time with the wife and kids. Then Nick Barnett and Jermichael Finley fired off a couple of tweets about a team photo, and the Internet might as well have exploded. Demovsky wasn't going anywhere. \"Here's what bothers me about [Twitter],\" he said. \"People tweet first and think later. I've seen more people apologize for the things they've tweeted. And the other thing is that it's limited to 140 characters. I always say we're dumbing down America, 140 characters at a time.\" But social media is here to stay, and it's all over the news. In Egypt, Facebook and other forms of social media are being used by people on all sides of that nation's crisis to spread information and show solidarity. Back here in the U.S., Twitter has been responsible for three of the biggest stories in the NFL postseason. As with any technology, there are some people who aren't sure what to make of it yet, especially those older than 30. From Jay Cutler's knee to the spat between Antonio Cromartie and Matt Hasselbeck to the revenge of the injured reserves, Twitter appears to be a massive headache for NFL coaches, execs and PR types. But it's also a resource for athletes who want their unfiltered thoughts disseminated to the masses. And it's brought fans as close to athletes as they've been in decades. \"I think Twitter provides an authenticity and an immediacy that you never really used to have,\" said David Katz, founder and CEO of sportsfanlive.com. \"It used to be that these athletes were probably sitting at home, probably screaming at the television exactly what you see them tweeting today. \"So instead of screaming, they're tweeting. What was once a private conversation is published to the masses.\" So they took it to the people last week, opened up and shared their innermost thoughts, because Nick Barnett and Jermichael Finley were hurt that the Packers were taking their team picture before the injured guys arrived in Cowboys. After some back-and-forth, a thousand news reports and at least one meeting, coach Mike McCarthy decided to change the date to Friday. It was much ado about nothing, the old-school coach said. He added that he has no time for things like Twitter. End of story. But is it ever over when scandal is just a couple of smart-phone taps away? This one, today at least, appears to have subsided. Demovsky sat at his laptop Friday, which is always signed on to Twitter these days because it has to be. A tweet popped up from JermichaelF88. \"Heading to the Team Photo!\" it read. \"Smile big! LMAO.\" hey Matt if u have something to then say it be a man about it. Don't erase it. I will smash ur face in. -- Jets defensive back Antonio Cromartie, responding to a tweet from Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck Back in the old days, you had filters. You played 60 minutes of football, you boiled over with anger, frustration, pain and pride, but then you went into the locker room and had a cooling-off period of at least 10 minutes before the media traipsed in with cameras and notepads. There are nasty things said in the heat of battle, things a football player wishes he could take back. Packers defensive line coach Mike Trgovac has had a few of those moments. But they were face to face, with just one or two people listening, not 2 million. \"The players need to understand,\" Trgovac said, \"that when you send an electronic message like that, bam! The whole world has it. And you can't pull it back. So you'd better make dang sure that what you're saying is what you want out there.\" Matt Hasselbeck was hit with a case of Twitter remorse in late January. He responded to a Antonio Cromartie rant about the NFL labor dispute with a tweet that said, \"Somebody ask Antonio Cromartie if he knows what CBA stands for.\" He later deleted the tweet, then brushed it off by saying he was in a bad mood when he woke up. But their tiff filled several days of news holes and obviously left Antonio Cromartie miffed. At least one social media expert speculated that the recent dustups might be related to sheer boredom. The football season is almost over, and most of the players are sitting at home, competitive juices still flowing. Twitter, it seems, appeals to skill players and outgoing personalities. The phenomenon started, Katz says, when celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher and Shaquille O'Neal started tweeting a couple of years ago. \"All of a sudden, mainstream people started taking notice,\" Katz said. \"And then there were the events in Iran and other places around the world where it became a distribution outlet for news and info around those types of events. And that's really where this stuff caught fire.\" Lance Armstrong and Pete Carroll were sports' version of Twitter pioneers. Pete Carroll opened a Twitter account in January 2009. And soon, the minions logged on to read which airport Pete Carroll was buzzing through and what song was playing on his iPod. Last spring, Pete Carroll playfully tweeted clues about whom the Seahawks would draft by posting a list of 13 songs, including \"Smooth Criminal\" by Michael Jackson and \"Back Door Man\" by The Doors. Steelers linebacker LaMarr Woodley says he opened his account with noble intentions. He wanted to give his fans an opportunity to become closer to him. He sends happy birthday tweets to some of them and gave away two Super Bowl tickets to a lucky follower via a Twitter contest. Packers linebacker Clay Matthews also uses Twitter to connect with his followers, more than 100,000 strong. When he arrived in Cowboys this week, he asked them to recommend restaurants. Multimillion-dollar contracts and isolated lifestyles might have distanced athletes from their fans years ago, but Clay Matthews and LaMarr Woodley see Twitter as a way for fans to see them as likeable guys. As real people. \"Sometimes, a fan might read something in the paper and say,'LaMarr, why'd you say that?'\" LaMarr Woodley said. \"You can finally speak to them. That's the biggest thing, communicating with your fans and having fun with them.\" BEARS fans I am so SORRY, I have to be crawling and cant get up to come off field, Josh Freeman would not come out, MEDS ARE AVAILABLE. -- Former Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks on Jay Cutler Isaac Redman doesn't tweet much anymore. He hates updating it all the time and publicizing to the world what he's doing. There's no privacy in the world anymore. Once an athlete steps out of his living room, he can be photographed and videotaped and uploaded on Facebook, and Redman isn't too keen on that. The Steelers running back is young, in his mid-20s, but he's already getting turned off by Twitter. He doesn't like the way things get blown out of proportion. He doesn't like the public skewerings that have taken place recently. Redman gets passionate when the subject of Jay Cutler comes up. How could his football brethren gang up on a guy like that? \"I expect that from people from the outside,\" Redman said. \"From people outside the NFL. But for actual players to comment on that, it makes no sense to me and it was kind of disrespectful.\" Redman got on Twitter because many of his teammates were doing it. Now he hates all the drama it produces. But Roy Peter Clark wonders whether Twitter, coupled with the macho world of football, eventually will give way to something far more dangerous. The senior scholar at the Poynter Institute, a school dedicated to teaching journalists, recently wrote that athletes exist in a \"shame\" culture, in which being embarrassed is worse than losing. \"What really interested me most about the story about Jay Cutler is how Twitter provided a kind of Pandora's box,\" he said, \"where you opened the top and all kinds of nasty stuff started coming out. I think that's new. I think that's very interesting. And I do think there is some danger attached to it. \"It is the danger of giving the athlete even more incentive not to come off the field no matter what the nature of the injury is.\" Before I delete this page just wanted to say I was never trying to be a distration... I am packer have been one for 8 going on 9 years. -- Packers linebacker Nick Barnett on Jan. 29 Nick Barnett has tweeted in haste before. In 2009, after fans blasted him for celebrating a tackle just after he missed another key one, he grabbed his phone and flailed away at the keys. \"KISS MY ASS,\" he wrote. He later apologized for it and said he was taking a break from Twitter. He said it made him let his guard down, made him feel as if he was talking to friends. He had fewer than 20,000 followers at the time. Now Nick Barnett has more than 388,000 and millions more watching. Nick Barnett quit Twitter last week, but the breakup lasted only a few days. He was back on again Wednesday, thanking his fans for the kind words during a difficult time. Of the 15 or 20 Packers who are on Twitter, Nick Barnett is one of the most prolific, Demovsky says. He's an emotional guy who plays with passion. He is injured and has a lot of time on his hands. And soon, hundreds of others might be in Nick Barnett's spot, all jacked up with nowhere to go. A labor lockout looms in the NFL, and if it stretches long into the spring, some athletes will no doubt take their frustrations out on Twitter. Will it speed up the negotiating process? Will it widen the gap? The world can change in a few months. Twitter is proof of that. \"A lot of these younger players are realizing it's the future for them,\" Katz said. \"But the one cautionary tale is that having Twitter in your pocket is the equivalent of having a loaded weapon in your pocket at all times. \"To me, it's reality television for a sports fan. You just sit there and watch what unfolds.\" Elizabeth Merrill is a senior writer for ESPN.com.

That isn't just Jerry Felix Jones' delusional line of thinking. Felix Jones recalls twice this season when the head coaches of teams that beat the Cowboys raved about the talent on the Cowboys roster during brief postgame chats on the field. \"It's pretty constant around the league,\" said Troy Aikman, the Fox broadcaster and Hall of Fame former Cowboys quarterback. \"Football people believe that the Cowboys are one of -- if not the -- most talented teams in the league.\" Maybe the most talented team in the league? Let's compare the Cowboys to the Packers, who just celebrated a Super Bowl championship in Jerry's $1.2 billion football palace. We'll go position group by position group, judging the Cowboys' healthy roster against the injury-depleted starting lineup the Packers used in their Super Bowl XLV win over the Steelers. This is done in consultation with ESPN Cowboys' Bryan Broaddus, who worked in the personnel departments of the Packers and Cowboys during his career as an NFL scout. (Broaddus won a Super Bowl ring during his tenure in Packers and lost his hair during his tenure in Cowboys.) The conclusion? Well, it isn't quite as lopsided as the Cowboys' loss at Lambeau Field in Wade Phillips' finale, but it's close. QUARTERBACKS: Felix Jones declared last week that Tony Romo is one of the top 10 quarterbacks in the league. That's a realistic view. Several Packers declared in the wake of their Super Bowl win that Aaron Rodgers is the NFL's best quarterback right now. That might also be a realistic view. It seems that everything Tony Romo does well, such as throw with accuracy and buy time with his feet, Aaron Rodgers does better. Edge: Packers RUNNING BACKS: The Packers, who lost Ryan Grant to an ankle injury early in the season, proved you don't have to have a dominant rushing attack to win a championship. Sixth-round rookie James Starks was Packers's lead back during its playoff run. He'd probably be the third back in Cowboys, and that's assuming that Marion Barber will be released in a cost-cutting move this summer. Felix Jones and Tashard Choice are at least an adequate tandem. The Cowboys still hope Felix Jones, who has had flashes of brilliance, can be a star. Edge: Cowboys WIDE RECEIVERS: \"We've got the best receiver group in the National Football League,\" Packers's Donald Driver said. \"We'll challenge anyone on that.\" The Cowboys might be able to counter by claiming the most talented tandem. Miles Austin and Dez Bryant, a pair of big, fast playmakers, might be the most talented tandem in the league. But Greg Jennings and Donald Driver have much more impressive track records of productivity. And the Packers' depth is astounding, as evidenced by number 4 receiver Jordy Nelson's nine-catch, 140-yard, one-touchdown Super Bowl performance. Edge: Packers TIGHT ENDS: Jason Witten is building a pretty strong case for Canton. Packers rookie Andrew Quarless did a solid job of filling in after Jermichael Finley suffered a season-ending injury. Jermichael Finley might be able to make this a decent debate one day, but it's a mismatch with Andrew Quarless, much like Jason Witten against most linebackers and safeties who try to cover him. Edge: Cowboys OFFENSIVE LINE: At this point in their careers, young Cowboys left tackle Doug Free is a better left tackle than his Packers counterpart, 11-year veteran Chad Clifton. It's probably a push at left guard and center, although Cowboys center Andre Gurode keeps getting Pro Bowl berths based on reputation. The Cowboys need to replace the right side of their line, while the Packers have one of the best guards in the game ( Josh Sitton) and a first-round rookie right tackle with a very bright future, Bryan Bulaga. Edge: Packers DEFENSIVE LINE: Jay Ratliff is a three-time Pro Bowler, but Packers's B.J. Raji might be the best 3-4 nose tackle in the NFL. B.J. Raji has prototypical bulk (6-2, 337) and is a disruptive presence (6.5 sacks this season). Packers's Cullen Mike Cullen Jenkins, a dominant run-stopper who had seven sacks this season, is by far the best defensive end on these two teams. Ryan Pickett, the Packers' other defensive end, is a lot like Cowboys' Igor Olshansky -- just a guy. Edge: Packers LINEBACKERS: Cowboys' DeMarcus Ware and Packers's Clay Matthews, a pair of outside linebackers who are on the short list of the league's most dominant defensive players, cancel each other out. Anthony Spencer is better than the Packers' tandem of Erik Walden and Frank Zombo, although Anthony Spencer was a major disappointment in 2010. The Packers have a significant edge at both inside linebacker positions. Packers's Desmond Bishop didn't start until Nick Barnett was injured, but Desmond Bishop is a physical player who also excels in coverage and earned a four-year, $19 million contract extension. The Cowboys hope Sean Lee can stay healthy and emerge as that type of player. Edge: Packers CORNERBACKS: The Cowboys' cornerbacks had a miserable 2010 season. The Packers' cornerbacks had a magnificent 2010 season. Cowboys' Terence Newman is a 30-something former Pro Bowler who showed significant signs of decline. Packers's Charles Woodson is a 30-something Pro Bowler who remains one of the most complete corners in the game. Cowboys' Mike Cullen Jenkins and Packers's Tramon Williams are both terrifically talented young corners, but Mike Cullen Jenkins was awful while Tramon Williams was awesome this season. Edge: Packers SAFETIES: Cowboys desperately needs to upgrade here. The Cowboys made a major misevaluation by handing Alan Ball a starting job, and there is little reason to be confident in Gerald Sensabaugh despite his late-season interception flurry. Packers's Charlie Peprah was a serviceable starter after second-round rookie Morgan Burnett's season-ending injury. The Packers' Nick Collins, a strong tackler with 17 picks in the past three seasons, is an elite strong safety.

Barring another appeal, the ruling appears to clear the way for the NFL to suspend the players, which it has been trying to do since both tested positive for a banned diuretic in 2008. The players have been fighting their suspensions and could appeal the latest decision to the state Supreme Court. Peter Ginsberg, an attorney for both players, said Tuesday he had not talked to his clients and wasn't sure whether they would seek another appeal. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the NFL is reviewing the decision and determining how to proceed. The Kevin Pat Williamses, who are not related, tested positive in 2008 for bumetanide, a banned diuretic in the StarCaps weight-loss supplement they were taking that can mask the presence of steroids. They were not accused of taking steroids and said they didn't know the diuretic was in the supplement. The players sued the NFL in state court, saying it violated state labor law. Their suspensions have been on hold while the case has been playing out in state and federal courts. Last May, Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson ruled the NFL broke state law when it failed to notify the players of their positive test results within the mandated three days. But the judge also declined to permanently block the NFL from suspending the players, saying they weren't harmed by the notification delays. The players appealed, asking that the suspensions be permanently blocked. A three-judge panel of the appeals court affirmed the lower court's decision to deny permanent relief from the suspensions -- but had different reasons for its decision. The appeals court ruled that bumetanide isn't defined as a drug under state law, so the NFL wasn't required to tell the players of its presence in the drug tests. According to the 11-page decision, the Kevin Pat Williamses provided urine samples for drug testing during their annual physical exams in 2008. The samples for each player were divided into separate bottles for testing purposes. Once an initial test read positive for bumetanide, the other samples were tested to confirm the presence of the diuretic. The appeals court ruled that because the purpose of those confirmatory tests was solely to detect the presence of bumetanide -- which state law doesn't define as a drug -- there is no legal basis for the court to find that the NFL violated the state's notification requirements. \"Accordingly, although we do not agree with the district court's interpretation of [state law], we nevertheless affirm its order denying injunctive relief,\" the appeals court ruled. The appeals court said that if the initial screening and subsequent tests had been positive for anabolic steroids -- which are defined as a drug by the state -- the NFL would have been subject to reporting requirements. Ginsberg, the Kevin Pat Williamses' attorney, said the court ruled the NFL has to follow the law, but because it was testing for bumetanide, the restrictions of the law don't apply to his clients. \"The NFL has again sort of lost the war but won the battle,\" Ginsberg said. He said he hopes the union takes a more proactive role in fashioning a better drug-testing policy in future contract negotiations with the NFL. Aiello said the NFL is pleased with the decision, saying it confirms that the NFL's testing program did not violate Vikings state law and \"vindicates the policy and procedures of the program.\" Pat Kevin Pat Williams, the oldest defensive player in the league last season at 38, finished a three-year contract and will be a free agent. The Vikings aren't expected to re-sign him. The three-time Pro Bowl pick has seen his production and playing time decrease the past few seasons. The 30-year-old Kevin Pat Williams also is coming off a substandard season, with a career-low one sack. The NFL had argued its anti-doping policy was a product of its collective bargaining agreement with the players' union and was governed by federal labor law, which should trump state laws. The case was watched by other major sports leagues -- including the MLB, NBA and NHL -- which supported the NFL and contended their drug-testing programs would be at risk if players were allowed to challenge drug-testing policies in different state courts. Saints defensive end Will Smith and former Saints end Charles Grant tested positive for the same substance, but were not involved in the Vikings lawsuit. The NFL has held off on enforcing their four-game suspensions until the Vikings case is resolved. Grant is currently a free agent.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6101481", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Pat Williams", "Saints", "Will Smith"]}, {"title": "Sports books clear just over $724,000", "author": null, "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Sports books in Nevada hung on to win just over $724,000 from Super Bowl bets despite heavy gambling on the Packers and lots of scoring, Nevada gambling regulators said Tuesday. The Nevada Gaming Control Board said $87.5 million were wagered on the NFL's championship game in 183 sports books across the state. Of those bets, casinos kept less than 1 percent. \"I can't say I've got a cheese head in my office right now,\" said Jay Kornegay, executive director of the race and sports book at the Las Vegas Hilton. Packers beat the Steelers 31-25 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday night. The Packers were a 2\u00bd-point favorite in most Las Vegas casinos, giving their supporters a win with the six-point victory. The combined 56 points scored helped bettors who gambled that the total would go over about 45 points. Mike Lawton, a research analyst with the control board, said that while some casinos won, others had moderate losses. \"There wasn't anyone that lost anything mind-blowing,\" he said. \"I think we were really worried about it being a loss -- it could have been worse.\" Gamblers wagered 5.5 percent more this year than last year, when Nevada casinos won $6.9 million on $82.7 million in Super Bowl bets as Saints beat Colts, 31-17. The Hilton took a slight loss on Sunday as those who gamble regularly on sports stayed on the sidelines, Kornegay said. \"The big sharp money just never materialized because they never got value,\" he said. Mike Colbert, race and sports director for Cantor Gaming, said his books won money because they were able to offset Packers bets with attractive wagers on Steelers. \"In this business, volume overcomes everything,\" said Colbert, who operates books for Cantor at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Tropicana Las Vegas, Hard Rock and M Resort casinos. Cantor also licenses its technology for during-game bets to the Venetian and Palazzo casinos. \"If you can do eight figures in handle, you're really going to be in a spot where you should not lose money,\" he said. In casino terms, handle refers to amounts wagered. Colbert said his books gave Steelers backers better odds than other casinos in Las Vegas, attracting money to offset strong support for Packers elsewhere. \"If you stayed there with a dead number... you surely were going to get beat,\" Colbert said. \"There was definitely money out there that was looking to bet Steelers.\" Casinos have lost once only once on the Super Bowl in the last 10 years, in 2008 when bettors gambled $92 million and casinos lost $2.57 million as the Giants beat Patriots, 17-14. This year was the slimmest winning Super Bowl for casinos since 1998, when books won $472,000 on $77.2 million in wagers. The Broncos beat Packers in that game, 31-24.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6101711", "Entities": ["Packers", "Steelers", "Cowboys", "Saints", "Colts", "Giants", "Patriots", "Broncos"]}, {"title": "Players from bottom of roster rise up", "author": "Ross Tucker", "date": "Feb 8, 2011", "content": "Frank Zombo. Jarrett Bush. Doug Legursky. Howard Green. These are the names of some of the players who came up big for their teams when it mattered the most in Super Bowl XLV. Yet, you have to think that at least 95 percent of the record-breaking television audience that watched another thrilling Super Bowl had never heard of any of them before Sunday evening. Sure, stars such as Aaron Rodgers, Clay Matthews, Greg Jennings and even Ben Roethlisberger made their share of plays. That is to be expected. But Bush, not even the Packers' nickelback but rather their dime (4th cornerback), making a great break on a ball for a key interception and then harassing and taking down the toughest quarterback in football later in the game? Um, no. Should it really come as a surprise? Not at all. Not in an era in which relative unknowns such as Tracy Porter pick off Brett Favre and Peyton Manning in back-to-back games and special-teams guy David Tyree makes a once-in-a-lifetime helmet catch to help knock off the previously undefeated Pats. It has become a clich\u00e9 to say football is the ultimate team sport, but it really is. Would the Packers have won the Super Bowl without the play Green made on Big Ben as he released the ball in the first half, leading to a Nick Collins interception return for a touchdown? Probably not. And that is why Green, a career vagabond who was jettisoned by the Jets midway through this season, is another fantastic story in a sport that continues to have plenty of them. How about Packers rookie running back James Starks? Maybe a decent chunk of the fans had begun to learn more about him over the course of the last month of the playoffs, but that doesn't make his stellar performance against the Steelers' run defense any less impressive. The Niagara Falls, N.Y., native, who didn't play his senior year at Bills because of an injury and really didn't do much of anything in the 2010 regular season, made his 11 carries count, gaining 52 yards for a 4.7 yards-per-carry average. So what is the lesson that should be learned by all of the other teams in the NFL, if they don't know it already? That the spots at the bottom of the roster, from 40-53 on an NFL team, are extremely valuable. That means everyone needs to pay attention, whether it comes to the last couple of rounds of the NFL draft or the final cuts in August. The players on the fringe of the roster may not warrant high draft choices or big free-agent dollars, but the players that a team decides to keep in those spots can really make a gigantic difference. Just ask the Packers. Q: What are your thoughts on Juan Castillo becoming defensive coordinator of the Eagles? Larry from New York A: Like a lot of people, I was very surprised when I first heard the news. I've never previously heard of moving an offensive line coach to the other side of the ball to become defensive coordinator. At a minimum, it opens head coach Andy Reid up to a tremendous amount of criticism if it doesn't work out. But does that really matter? Andy Reid is going to start to feel the heat and be under heavy scrutiny if the defense doesn't get better, no matter who the defensive coordinator is. There are some teams, such as the Patriots, that like to cross-train guys on both sides of the ball, so maybe that is what Andy Reid is going for. I do like that they now have arguably the best offensive and defensive line coaches in the league in Howard Mudd and Jim Washburn. That should pay immediate dividends. Q: As a Packer fan, of course I felt that Clay Matthews was deserving of the Defensive POY award. Don't get me wrong, Troy Polamalu is one heck of a player and seemingly a sure HOF player when his career ends, so take nothing away from what he has accomplished, he's well-deserving. My question is, coming from someone who's been inside the huddle, does NOT winning one of these awards motivate a player even more? Clay has seemingly always come from behind in his career, and I feel as though he did it again during Super Bowl XLV. Kevin from Milwaukee A: Well, I was never even in the stratosphere of any awards like that, Kevin, so I wouldn't personally know. I can tell you, however, I have had several teammates that took things like a Pro Bowl snub very personally and used it to motivate them all year long. Things like that can add just a little extra fuel to the fire, and I wouldn't doubt that Clay Matthews wanted to prove in the Super Bowl that he was the best defensive player on the field. I know he teased one reporter in the locker room after the game for picking Julius Peppers over him for the award, so whether he downplays it or not, it is on his mind. Q: Ross I'd love for you to comment on the Jay Cutler controversy. It seems that Jay Cutler was removed from the game because with an injury (major or minor) he would have hurt the team had he played at less than 100%. Now we hear the sad news that Eagles kicker David Akers played after hearing that his daughter had cancer. Should David Akers have been withdrawn by the Eagles management for the game because nobody could play at 100% after hearing that news? David from Cape Town, South Africa A: Pretty tough to compare those two, David. Let's start with Jay Cutler. I still have several questions regarding his injury, and those questions mainly revolve around how it was treated after he came out of the game. It wasn't. I really don't understand that. If he had an injury that was bad enough that they said it would have made him questionable for the Super Bowl, why was he standing on it on the sidelines instead of getting off his feet and icing it? And why would he be walking the streets of Los Angeles just two days after the game instead of getting treatment for his Grade 2 MCL tear? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. As for David Akers, I think it would probably be on him to let the team know he didn't feel he could perform because of a personal issue. There are a lot of players out there who compete with heavy hearts if they feel they are up for it. Brett Favre famously did that on a Monday night against the Raiders after his father passed away. That doesn't mean David Akers should have, it just means that the player probably knows himself the best and knows whether or not he can handle it. To David Akers' credit, he has never used it as an excuse for missing those kicks. Q: I would like to hear your thoughts on an 18-game schedule in regards to this one thing that isn't being mentioned by ANYBODY. Rushing yards, passing yards, touchdowns, etc. In an 18-game season these records are going to be shattered. I just hate the thought of an above-average player finishing his career with identical statistics to that of Hall of Famers such as Ray Lewis and Dan Marino, etc. Tim from Toronto A: I understand where you are coming from, Tim, and I'm sure there are others who feel the same way, but I am not a big stat guy. Never have been. I think they are already skewed by weather, system, teammates, coaching philosophy, rules of the game, etc. Numbers can and often do lie, but the film never does. And keep in mind the season has already increased from 14 games to 16 once, so all of the records have a certain level of taint to them.

The Steelers have been to three Super Bowls in six years, and even though their defense is aging, don't count the Steelers out for getting back to the big game. Over the past six years, the Steelers and Packers taught the rest of the NFL that playoff seeds are meaningless, as long as a low seed has the right quarterback and a good defense. Both franchises won Super Bowls -- the Packers in 2011 and the Steelers in'06 -- despite being sixth seeds. Though it's hard to repeat trips to the Super Bowl, the Steelers and Packers will be in the mix in 2011. But here are five other franchises that will be in the hunt for the next Super Bowl. 1. Patriots -- Tom Brady has to figure out the reason for his recent flat performances in playoff games, dating back to his Super Bowl loss to the Giants. Injuries have played a role in those non-Tom Brady-like performances. This is probably something Bill Belichick has to address. The offensive line has shown the wear and tear from age and needs serious upgrades. The front office needs to patch up the relationship with guard Logan Mankins and get him a long-term deal. With two picks in each of the first three rounds, the Patriots can continue their youth movement and do it with quality. 2. Colts -- As long as Peyton Manning is behind center, the Colts are always a Super Bowl threat. Turmoil within the AFC South -- Jeff Fisher's firing and the tenuous situations of Gary Kubiak in Texans and Jack Del Jack Del Rio in Jaguars -- will only help the Colts maintain the number 1 spot in the division. But the Colts have to get Peyton Manning under contract. They have made him an offer to be the highest-paid player in the league. They believe they can franchise him if they don't get the long-term deal done. The Colts also have to find a way to improve their run blocking. Tight end Cowboys Clark and receivers Anthony Gonzalez and Austin Collie should be healthy next year, making it easier for Peyton Manning to run his offense more smoothly. 3. Saints -- The union of Sean Payton's mind and Drew Brees' ability to execute plays will keep the Saints in the Super Bowl hunt for the next several years. Free agency, though, could make the journey tough next season. Four of the team's top six offensive linemen -- as well as safety Roman Harper -- are free agents. The schedule won't help the Saints, either, with eight games against the NFC North and AFC South. They also draw the Giants and a Rams team that is being built around quarterback Sam Bradford. 4. Falcons -- To make the Super Bowl nowadays, a team has to have the type of elite quarterback who can carry it through the playoffs. Matt Ryan has that ability, but he has to take the next step after going 0-2 in playoff games in his first three seasons. A tougher schedule makes it doubtful the Falcons can repeat the 13-3 season of 2010. Head coach Mike Smith, who just signed a three-year extension, will have to tighten up a defense that struggled against the run and can be vulnerable to top quarterbacks in passing situations. Michael Turner was able to bounce back from a disappointing 2009 season, but the toll of his numerous carries could catch up to him if he doesn't train hard this offseason. The Falcons' offense stresses balance, but it might have to start focusing on the pass if Michael Turner can't keep repeating his powerful inside runs week to week. 5. Ravens -- I almost went with the Chargers because of Philip Rivers, but they have major holes to fill in their starting lineup. The Ravens have a complete roster. Quarterback Joe Flacco has won four road playoff games. Ray Rice offers big plays for the running game. The defense has some age, but it remains strong. General manager Ozzie Newsome upgraded the receiving corps last season with the Anquan Boldin trade. His next mission is adding a downfield threat. Defenses with three good man-to-man cornerbacks shut down the slower, older Ravens receivers this season and made it tough for Joe Flacco to follow through on his progressions.

The league initially said Sunday it would give $2,400, three times the face value of the ticket, to the fans who were forced to watch the game on monitors or use standing-room platforms after some temporary seating sections were not completed in time. On Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said those fans also would receive tickets to next year's Super Bowl. Then on Tuesday, the NFL announced the fans could choose instead to receive a ticket to any future Super Bowl, including next year's, along with round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. If fans choose that option, they will not get the $2,400. They can wait until after the conference championship games each season to see whether their favorite team reaches the Super Bowl. \"We had more time to think about how to create a broader range of options that would better recognize the deep emotional bond that fans have for their team,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello wrote in an e-mail Tuesday. The Packers beat the Steelers 31-25 on Sunday at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. When the temporary sections were not completed before the start of the game, about 850 fans were moved to other seats. But there was nowhere to put the remaining 400. Some of the affected fans complained Sunday that the $2,400 didn't cover the price they paid for the seats, travel and hotels. If fans choose the first option of next year's game plus the $2,400, the ticket is transferable, which means it can be sold on the secondary ticket market. It won't be transferable in the other option. The league said a senior NFL staff member would call each of the displaced fans to provide information about the options and answer questions. \"The commissioner thought it was the right thing to do to give those fans more options,\" Aiello said. The NFL is working with the Packers, Steelers and Cowboys to track down all the affected fans.

He was removed from the grit and sweat of the sidelines, unable to feel and hear his players as they worked. The booth was at an antiseptic remove, far above the real battle. But Paterno -- and we're using him because he's the only one other than Charlie Weis we can remember who had the experience -- said something interesting when he was asked to list the advantages and disadvantages of game-day coaching from high above the field. The booth, he said, provided a better location for the \"technical analysis\" of the game. To which the question needs to be asked: Is there another human endeavor that has become defined by \"technical analysis\" more than football coaching? In the NFL, especially, coaches are asked to make instant technical analysis of what they see. They have help, but in the end it's their reputations -- and their jobs -- on the line. By definition, NFL head coaches should be the best minds the franchise has to offer. So why aren't they positioned to benefit from the best vantage point the game has to offer? I've been fortunate enough to watch football games from just about every vantage point -- from the press box (equivalent to coaches' booth), sideline (thanks, UFL) and just about every angle in the stands. By far the best place to watch -- the place that provides the best of all possible angles for technical analysis -- is the press box, with the combination of the aerial view and the access to network television replays. There's a reason radio and TV announcers sit up high, and there's also a reason sideline reporters add very little to your understanding of what happens on the field. This is just a post-football rumination after watching a season that held more than its share of blunders in the area of \"technical analysis.\" If I were an NFL head coach, I'd want to sit up there. If I were an NFL owner or general manager, I would suggest -- or at least raise the possibility -- of my head coach sitting in a booth, where the offensive coordinator generally sits. There are two aspects of coaching that are botched more than any others: (1) clock management, and (2) replay decisions. In many cases, a mistake with a replay decision can have a significant effect on a coach's ability to manage the clock. In both cases, being in the booth would help a head coach. The booth would create a level of emotional distance that would undoubtedly help a coach manage the clock. It seems impossible that someone like Colts coach Jim Caldwell would be as bad at clock management if he were able to see the game from a safe remove. It's hard to understand when you're watching on television, but a coach standing on the field doesn't always have the same relationship with the clock as a guy sitting on his couch. It's not as prominent in real life, on the sideline, as it is to the viewer who watches it ticking down on his television screen. In the booth, that would change. The benefit for replay is self-evident. Broadcasters and viewers know better than coaches when a challenge should be made, and when it will be successful. Since the head coach is presumably the best mind, he should be the one making the decision armed with the most knowledge. As it stands now, there are assistants in the booth above relaying the information to the head coach; on questionable calls, such as Mike McCarthy's decision on whether to challenge Brett Swain's near-catch, it's not hard to imagine the guy up above saying, \"You could challenge it -- your call.\" No matter how the suggestions are sent down through the headset, the head coach is the guy shouldering the blame/credit. Oftentimes, he might be in the worst position to know. There are benefits to being on the sideline. It's hard to motivate from a luxury box, obviously, and conversing with officials is no longer an option. There are also times when a head coach doesn't want to wait for halftime to discipline/calm/inspire in a man-to-man, face-to-face, eye-to-eye way. Beyond that, the sideline might be the absolute worst place to watch a game if your job description includes \"technical analysis.\" If it was a good place to watch a game, they wouldn't need the headset. One other thing: It's the opinion here that Ohio State is the most complete college basketball team since the 2001 Jay Williams-Shane Battier-Mike Dunleavy-Carlos Boozer-Chris Duhon Duke team. With a win this Saturday over Wisconsin -- no sure thing, but likely -- count on the Buckeyes entering the NCAA tournament undefeated. They're that good. In the current college climate, with even the best teams fortunate to have two big-time players and a sufficient supporting cast, the Buckeyes are a rare collection. They don't have any glaring weaknesses. They can defend inside and out, shoot it outside, score from the post and rebound. And, obviously, Jared Sullinger is exactly the type of player who leads teams to titles. But there's something else about this team that separates it from just about everybody else: They play the kind of physical game -- especially Cowboys Lauderdale and Sullinger -- that referees allow. Put more accurately, it's the kind of style that referees grow to accept. Don't discount this as a huge factor in the tournament. The Buckeyes have established this tough, physical style as their brand of play throughout the regular season, and their consistency will give them the benefit of the doubt in March.

Temperatures were in the single digits as the celebration began, but the Packer diehards were undaunted. Fans in the front row of the stadium traded high-fives with the players and reached out to touch the championship trophy as coach Mike McCarthy marched past with the hardware hoisted high over his head. The Lombardi Trophy carries special meaning in Packers because it's named for the Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. \"I will never forget this,\" said Amanda Lee, 33, of Milwaukee, who wore the number 12 jersey of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Super Bowl MVP. \"I got to touch the trophy, but I couldn't actually feel it [because her hands were so cold]. I touched Aaron Rodgers' pinkie! I'll never wash my hand again.\" The celebration capped a party that has been going nonstop in Packers since Sunday, when the Packers defeated the Steelers 31-25 in Arlington, Texas, to win their fourth Super Bowl title and first since 1996. The ceremony shone a spotlight on the decades-old love affair between the team and the NFL's smallest-market city. On Sunday night, thousands took to the streets to celebrate amid an explosion of green-and-gold fireworks. On Monday, tens of thousands of hoarse but giddy fans lined the roads from Austin Straubel International Airport to Lambeau to cheer on the team's motorcade as it returned to the stadium. The 56,000 tickets for the official \"Return to Titletown\" ceremony Tuesday sold out within hours on Monday. Fans from far and wide were in the stadium's parking lot early Monday morning, grilling brats, throwing down beers and tossing footballs in a final tailgate party -- never mind a wind chill of 14 below. \"The weather's fine. I can barely feel it,\" Ken Hampp, 23, of Appleton, said in the Lambeau parking lot as he sipped a Budweiser, before it froze. \"That's my favorite thing about winter. You can just stick your beer in the snow.\" The stadium opened two hours before the ceremony. The atmosphere inside was electric as fans watched highlights from the past season on the stadium's giant television screens set to a rousing orchestral soundtrack. The crowd waved world champion flags, erupted into chants of \"Go Pack Go!\" and danced to House of Pain's \"Jump Around\" and the Village People's \"YMCA.\" Packers Mayor Jim Schmitt addressed the crowd from a stage on the 50-yard line, announcing the city would name a street \"Mike McCarthy's Way\" in keeping with a tradition that calls for the city to name a street after every Super Bowl-winning coach. Republican Gov. Scott Walker was next, generating a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. He handed Packers President Mark Murphy a proclamation declaring February Packers month. But the crowd was more interested in seeing their heroes than their politicians, as evidenced by signs that read \" Jordy Nelson, Will You Be My Valentine?\" and \" Clay Matthews Will You Marry Me?\" Kimberly Zachary, 19, of La Crosse, held a sign that read \"Donald Driver Your Smile Makes It All Worth While,\" referring to veteran wide receiver Donald Driver, whose ever-present grin has helped him emerge as a fan heartthrob. She said she chose to attend college at the University of Wisconsin-Packers in part because of the Packers. \"It's like going to a school for a boyfriend or girlfriend,\" Zachary's friend, Kelly Peerendboom, 20, of Tomahawk said. Then she sighed. \"I don't think I've ever felt so happy to be part of a team.\" When the players finally emerged from the tunnel that leads to the field from their locker room, the crowd erupted, purging 14 years of frustration. The players, bundled up in parkas and stocking caps, strolled along the front row of the stadium on their way to the stage, smiling, pumping their fists and high-fiving everyone who could reach them. \"Just a very special moment,\" safety Nick Collins told the crowd from the stage. \"Something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. I've been chasing this dream for a long, long time, and I'm just glad to be a part of it.\" Donald Driver, who injured an ankle in the Super Bowl and couldn't finish the game, seemed overwhelmed by the moment. \"We're Super Bowl champs, baby! All season long, you guys believed.... We love you guys so much,\" he said. Team officials saved Aaron Rodgers for last. With a towel wrapped around his head like a scarf, Aaron Rodgers yelled into the microphone, \"What's up, Titletown?\" The crowd responded with a roar. \"We did it together! We brought that title home! We love you!\" Aaron Rodgers said. \"I tell you what, Packers, we're going to be right here next year doing the exact same thing!\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6101078", "Entities": ["Packers", "Mike McCarthy", "Aaron Rodgers", "Steelers", "Jordy Nelson", "Clay Matthews", "Donald Driver", "Nick Collins"]}, {"title": "Bears hibernate, but not Bears fans", "author": "Jon Greenberg", "date": "Feb 9, 2011", "content": "CHICAGO -- The snow is still Garrett Wolfe -high on my block and every pixilated image of Jay Cutler in shorts and a cardigan, sourpuss-ing his way through life, just makes me angry. Mostly because he gets to wear flip-flops outdoors and we're stuck here with wet socks, lamenting the Packers' win in the Super Bowl. Football won't be back until August, hopefully, but there's plenty of sports moments to look forward to in Bears before the Bears (hopefully) return to training camp. Here are some important dates to consider: Feb. 14, 17: Pitchers and catchers report! It's not exactly a moment worthy of thrill, but it is that age-old sign that winter is ending and spring is around the corner. The Cubs report on the 14th and the White Sox three days later. Feb. 15: Some would-be Cubs commentator starts worrying about Matt Garza's pitch count. Feb. 18: Ozzie Guillen goes on a rant about Will Ohman's predilection for playing country music in the clubhouse. Oney Guillen tweets that country music is for [expletives] and [expletives]. White Sox cancel Country Music Tweet-up. Feb. 19: A day before Derrick Rose takes the national stage in Los Angeles, his alma mater, Simeon Career Academy, takes on Benet Academy in the City-Suburban Showdown at the UIC Pavilion. Simeon sophomores Jabari Parker and Kendrick Nunn bolster an undefeated team against Northwestern -bound David Sobolewski's squad. While every Bears hoops fan should check out a City League game once a year, if they can find out the times and locations of said games, which are seemingly scheduled like raves, this event isn't shabby either. Feb. 20: Rose isn't just our Most Valuable Bearsan anymore. He's been buttressing a once-provincial MVP argument all season, and his first All-Star Game start in sunny Los Angeles should be a boon to a promising career. It will be interesting to see how Rose interacts with fellow All-Stars, most notably the Heat and Celtics who populate the roster, but I'm really looking forward to the introductions. Rose has already said he won't do any kind of goofy dance, like LeBron James and Dwight Howard do, mostly because he doesn't want to embarrass himself. I'll be in Vegas this weekend and I'm looking for a sports book that will take my bet that he does the \"robot.\" Feb. 20: Also, the Bears Blackhawks, still battling for a playoff spot, host the Steelers Penguins at 2:30 p.m. on NBC. The \"Madhouse on Madison\" will be rocking and the Blackhawks will pull out a 3-2 win in overtime, exciting their fans, new and old. ESPN Bears's Jesse Rogers will break down the game the next morning on ESPN 1000 to the 25 listeners who still care. Feb. 24: The Heat return to the United Center and, most likely, so does Joakim Noah, who has been out since mid-December after thumb and hand surgery. The Bulls have actually gained ground in the Eastern Conference without Noah, but they have no chance at making it out of the second round of the playoffs without the big man. When the two teams last met at the United Center, James missed the game and Dwyane Wade wondered why the home fans would cheer him hitting the deck. Chris Bosh also made news by criticizing Omer Asik's wild stallion hustle. This could be a playoff preview and there's no love lost between Noah and James. Noah also has made some dry comments about Bosh's flirtations with the Bulls. March 18-20: The NCAA tournament returns to the United Center and it's a good thing because once again, our college teams range from disappointing ( Illinois, Northwestern) to invisible ( Loyola, Bears State) to horrible ( Illinois-Bears) to really horrible ( DePaul). If Northwestern makes the tournament for the first time, it will be the biggest sports story in this town since Jay Cutler took the stairs at Mastro's. In a perfect world, I'd like to see my Ohio Bobcats run the table in the MAC tournament and get slotted here, so Bearsans could see local D.J. Cooper play the point. I'd also love to see underdog Vermont, whose star forward, Evan Fjeld, sports the sharpest mustache this side of Da Coach himself. April 1: White Sox open season at Browns. I'm predicting 45 degrees, 45 fans, 45 expletives from Ozzie Guillen about how cold it is, how few fans are there and how [expletive] Browns is, in general. April 2: Callers flood the air on local sports talk radio after Adam Dunn strikes out twice and hits two home runs. \"He needs to take more pitches!\" April 10: Blackhawks' regular season ends with a home game versus the Lions Red Wings. Maybe this game decides the team's playoff fate. Or maybe, if the Hawks' Stanley Cup hangover continues, most of you can officially stop pretending you care about hockey until the fall. May 1 or thereabouts: James leads the Heat into a second-round series with the Bulls. It will be hyped as the biggest sporting event in Bears since... the Bears hosted the Packers. Let's hope this one goes better. One thing's for sure, with the Heat in town, local nightclub receipts will skyrocket. June 17-19: The New York Yankees come to Wrigley Field, which means the possible return of wayward son Mark Prior. The marketing geniuses at the Cubs mark the occasion with Towel Night. Larry Rothschild gets booed six times, earning his 20,000th boo at the park. \"I couldn't have done it without Mark,\" he says later. June 20-22: The White Sox host the Cubs at the Cell. Last year, Carlos Zambrano went crazy in the dugout and raged his way to a suspension and anger management class. The year before that Milton Bradley threw a dugout fit and got booted by Lou Piniella. The easy pick to get tossed this year would be Garza, but I'm going with reserve outfielder Fernando Perez, who will toss his helmet in the stands in anger and get the hook from Mike Quade. Perez won't be mad because he struck out but, rather, because a fan looked like the editor of the Kenyon Review, which rejected his newest prose poem, \"Reflections of Crane Kenney.\" July 1-3: Cubs vs. White Sox at Wrigley Field. Winner gets BP Cup. Or is it loser gets BP Cup? I can't keep this straight. July 22-24: Cubs offer their 15th new ticket plan of 2011 for the three-game set against the Astros. Buy five tickets in the upper deck, get a statue. July 30 or thereabouts: Will the Bears report to training camp or will they be locked out? Will Jay Cutler address why everyone hates him? And will this be the start of the 8-8 season we all predicted in 2010? One thing's for sure, at least it will be warm again. Now if you'll excuse me, my car is buried under five feet of snow.

Woicik is the only player or coach with six Super Bowl rings, having won three with Cowboys (1992, 1994, 1995) and three with the Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004). He was the Cowboys' strength coach from 1990 to 1996 before spending the next three years in Saints. The Cowboys were 89-38 during his seven seasons, including 12 playoff wins. A Massachusetts native, he joined the Patriots in 2000 when Bill Belichick took over as coach. Woicik's contract with the Patriots was set to expire after the 2010 season, according to sources, and the sides have not reached an extension, opening the door for him to land elsewhere. Woicik has a connection with Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, who joined the team as a backup quarterback in 1993. Patriots spokesman Stacey James could not confirm Woicik's contract status. Woicik, 54, was named the NFL's strength coach of the year in 1992 and 2004 by the Professional Football Strength and Conditioning Society.

Sean Payton confirmed Tuesday that he buying a house in Cowboys and is moving his wife and two children to Texas while he remains the Saints' head coach. \"When my wife and I relocated our family from Cowboys, we had always dreamed of someday settling there,\" Sean Payton said is a statement released by the team. \"We feel that now is the best time to do this. It's a decision that I'm sure many families have to confront, and I don't know if there is any one right or wrong decision - just the best one you can make for your own family.\"' The decision is not sitting will with numerous Saints fans who've expressed consternation and confusion over the matter on call-in shows and internet chat sites. Saints owner Tom Benson and Mickey Loomis both issed statements of support and sounded confident that Sean Payton was committed to sticking with the club that first made him a head coach in January of 2006. \"Sean is our head coach,\" Benson said. \"Like we do with everyone in our organization, we support them when they need to make tough personal decisions. Sean is making a decision in the best interest of his family and he needs our support and he will get it. What I do know is that Sean is completely focused on bringing our team back to a championship.\" Loomis pointed out that it is not uncommon for coaches to coach in one city while their permanent home is in another. Former Colts coach Tony Dungy did so with the Colts while his family lived in Florida. In the NBA, current New Jersey Nets coach Avery Johnson maintains his permanent home in Texas. \"This is a personal family matter for Sean and his family and after discussing it with him, I support his decision,\" Loomis said. \"We spoke of numerous other coaches that have done the same thing successfully. I am confident that Sean will continue to be an excellent head coach for the Saints for many years to come and he remains steadfast to get our team back to the Super Bowl and bring the Lombardi Trophy back to Saints.\" Even if that is the case, Saints is unlike any other NFL city because of the bond between fans and the team. The relationship has transcended the action on the gridiron since Hurricane Katrina devastated Saints. Sean Payton has taken a public relations beating the last 24 hours as rumors about his family's move began to circulate and fester for more than a day before he finally issued a statement. Readers of the Times-Picayune's web site, nola.com, posted hundreds of messages on the subject, many expressing disenchantment with a coach they had seen as a pillar of the community. Because Sean Payton had been an assistant coach in Cowboys from 2003-05 and maintains a friendly relationship with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, numerous fans worried that Sean Payton may have designs on returning to his former employer. Others were simply insulted and accused the coach of hypocrisy. Not only had Sean Payton played a leading role in helping the Saints promote their mission to rebuild the city since Hurricane Katrina, he had also published a book, after the 2010 Super Bowl triumph, entitled: \"Home Team - Coaching the Saints and Saints Back To Life.\" Now Sean Payton is making a change that many interpret as the coach essentially saying their town is no longer good enough for the coach's wife, Beth, and their two children, Meghan and Connor. The subject dominated call-in shows, where some wondered allowed whether Sean Payton was having trouble with his marriage, while others urged angry fans to stay out of the coach's personal business and give him the benefit of the doubt. In his book, Sean Payton recalled that when he was hired by the Saints, he considered keeping his family in Cowboys, but the Saints refused, fearful it would send the wrong message. Sean Payton wrote that he realized then that, if one was going to join the Saints after Katrina, they had to be \"All in.\" Sean Payton moved into a suburban development in Mandeville, on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. A couple years later, however, Sean Payton's family had to move out of the house because it had been built with wallboard from China that was found to emit chemicals under hot and humid conditions that ruined metals in everything from jewelry to electrical wiring. The home had to be gutted and the interior rebuilt before the Sean Paytons could get back in. Now they're on the move again, to a place where his children will attend a new school and make new friends - most of them Cowboys fans.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6102666", "Entities": ["Sean Payton", "Cowboys", "Saints", "Colts"]}, {"title": "Doug Free could become expensive", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Feb 9, 2011", "content": "The Cowboys have 13 free agents to deal with whenever a new collective bargaining agreement is finished. There is just one player the Cowboys need to worry about: Doug Free. After the 2009 season, Doug Free gave the Cowboys hope he could move to left tackle and replace Flozell Adams. Here is what Doug Free did in his first season at left tackle: He allowed just five sacks and seven quarterback hits, zero the last eight weeks of the season. He also committed nine penalties for 55 yards, with seven false starts. According to Pro Football Focus, which ranks players using statistical analysis, Doug Free was the fourth-best tackle in the NFL in 2010. He ranked behind Andrew Whitworth of Bengals, Jake Long of Dolphins and Kareem McKenzie of the Giants. The CBA will have a tremendous impact on what the Cowboys can do with Doug Free. If Doug Free becomes an unrestricted free agent, he could get franchised. A franchised player gets a payday of the top five average salaries at his position or 120 percent of that player's previous base salary, whichever is greater. In 2009, franchised linemen received $10.7 million. If the new CBA forces Doug Free to become a restricted free agent, then he can receive a tender offer which would be far lower financial figure than if he were franchised. Last season, wide receiver Miles Austin was given a first- and third-round tender worth about $3 million. If a team had signed Miles Austin away, it would have had to surrender a first- and third-round picks. The Cowboys could also work out a new deal with Doug Free, but what to offer him is uncertain. Jimmy Sexton, Doug Free's agent, refused to comment regarding what the Cowboys might do with his client. It's clear the organization values him as evident of all the positive comments coming from Jason Garrett, Hudson Houck and Stephen and Jerry Jones. Left tackle is a valued position, and once you get a quality player there you don't want to lose him. Flozell Adams missed just 10 games in 11 years at left tackle. He was a rock until his body gave out on him in 2009. This is where Doug Free took over and proved his worth. Now the only question is what to pay him. Let's get to this week's mailbag. Q: Can [former Cowboys mayor] Laura Von Miller receive a little blame for the Super Bowl disaster? After all, if the stadium was built where it was originally intended to be, Cotton Bowl, the Super Bowl and all of its festivities would've been confined to one city. Even with the bad ice, travel would've been greatly reduced along with out-of-state complaints. -- Rhett (Euless, Texas) A: Rhett, that's a valid point. If the Super Bowl were in the Fair Park area, Cowboys would have dominated most of the Super Bowl action. I do believe Fort Worth would have still received something from the NFL, whether it be the AFC team staying there -- which the Steelers did last week -- or NFL Experience. But credit Arlington for stepping up when necessary to get the Cowboys to Arlington. It's all about making deals, and the city of Cowboys failed in this area when it came to the Cowboys. Q: What's the latest with Dez Bryant and his injury? Will he make it through this next season? It seems to be an on-going thing to even when he was at Oklahoma State. -- Mark Alan (Anthony Spencer, Iowa) A: Dez Bryant is off crutches and hopes to start running soon. He was pretty injury-prone this past season and some of it had to do with him not playing in nearly a year. He's such a physical player. You see him trying to run through tackles, and sometimes two or three defenders have to bring him down. It takes a toll on his body. Dez Bryant's conditioning was an issue at the start of rookie minicamp but it seemed to get better as the year progressed. He needed to lose about 15 pounds, which he did. The only thing for him to do is master the mental part of the game. I think Dez Bryant will be fine from a physical standpoint going forward. Q: How's the quarterback situation going to play out? I don't think [Tony] Romo has ever been a strong leader and [Jon] Kitna is on his last leg. Do you see a new quarterback in the future or at least a new backup? It looks like Arkansas' Ryan Mallet will be available. -- Rich C (Yulee, Fla.) A: Rich, I'm going to be as gentle as can be: What's wrong with you? There is nothing wrong with the quarterback position. Romo is one of the top 10 quarterbacks in the NFL. You want to give up on him? Kitna proved he can be a valuable backup, and Jason Garrett said he liked the poise of Stephen McGee toward the end of 2010. I do think the Cowboys should draft a quarterback on the last day of the draft if one is worthy. But Romo, Kitna and McGee will be the quarterbacks in 2011. Q: What's up with the safety position? [Gerald] Sensabaugh is a good lock for strong safety, but what's going on about the free safety? Do you think they're going to stick with Alan Ball or go for a safety in the draft? What about free agency? Besides the defensive line, that's really my only concern about that defense. -- Leo W. (Bills, N.Y.) A: Not sure if Sensabaugh is going to return. The Cowboys are going to let him test a crowded marketplace. If the Cowboys think they can match or give him something more than what he expects in the free-agent market, then he will return. Alan Ball is tricky. He's a free agent, and depending on what the new CBA will look like, he might be a restricted free agent. The Cowboys might keep him by default and let him compete for a starting free safety job. I suspect the team will draft a safety this year with the goal of giving that rookie significant playing time. Q: If the Cowboys decide to draft a more explosive OLB like Von Miller or Robert Quinn, do you think Anthony Spencer could be moved inside since he's got the size and he's strong against the run? -- Chris (Holmdel, N.J.) A: I think you keep Anthony Spencer outside if you draft Von Miller. Von Miller is projected to be there around 8-12, so why not get him? Jason Garrett wants to create competition, and he gets it with Von Miller and Anthony Spencer battling for an outside linebacker spot. I don't think Anthony Spencer is strong enough to be an inside linebacker. He's got the speed and moves to scoot past tackles, but not sure if he can handle guards and centers one-on-one in small spaces.

Thanks to all for writing in with some insightful and thoughtful e-mails. The biggest topic this week was owner Robert Kraft's remarks Friday at the Super Bowl and what to make of them. Some trades with the Super Bowl champion Packers are also revisited, as well as areas that the Patriots can improve in 2011. Let's get right to it. Q. Mike, when asked last week why the Pats lost to the Jets in the divisional round, Robert Kraft made clear reference to the game plan. I am sure I was not the only one taken slightly by surprise here, as these comments seem quite out of character. I can't believe I am asking this but do you see him growing impatient with the coach? Does Bill have to go deep into the playoffs next year? -- John (Fort Lauderdale) A. John, I thought the fan in Kraft came out with those remarks. I didn't read into them any further in terms of what it might mean for Bill Belichick's future from an ownership perspective. I think Kraft realizes he has one of the top coaches in the NFL and he also values the stability of having the same coach in place for a 12th season. So I don't think Bill Belichick needs to go deep in the playoffs or anything like that. On the flip side, I did wonder what Bill Belichick thought of the remarks. I can't imagine he'd be thrilled. Q. Mike, you're clearly a big fan of Robert Kraft but I feel like he's starting to overstep his boundaries a little bit with the \"good game plan\" comment, the \"lazy\" Tom Brady pick quote and the whole feud with Logan Mankins that will probably pave the way for his exit. Don't you think Kraft needs to remind himself that his only true asset to this team is his money and that he needs to stay out of the football aspect? -- Dan (Massachusetts) A. Dan, I respect what Kraft has done as owner of the Patriots, although that doesn't mean I would shy away from criticism if I felt it was warranted. As for his remarks, I appreciated them as a reporter covering the team because they seemed to be unfiltered and reflected what he was really thinking. That's always the goal -- to uncover the truth. If I was removing myself from the job, and focusing solely on what was in the best interests of the Patriots, I would agree with your point that Kraft's remarks didn't seem to do anything to help the team. Q. Mike, where do you see the Patriots going with their draft picks? I can see three spots of need: edge rusher, offensive line, and a stud running back. I know BenJarvus Green-Ellis has done the job, but he's not on the minds of the opposing defense when game-planning. A running back can be interchangeable, however it seems to be a very valuable position to fill for those games when Tom Brady alone can't shoulder the burden of the team. It's not a coincidence the last SB win for the Pats included Corey Dillon's 1600-plus yard season, and his clock-killing runs played a huge role in keeping Indy's defense off the field in the divisional round of that playoff. -- Mike K. (High Bridge, N.J.) A. Mike, I could see that scenario unfolding, although I could also see the running back exchanged with a defensive end in the 3-4 alignment. As for the running back spot, I still envision the Patriots drafting at that position, or signing a free agent, to complement BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Danny Woodhead. It will all depend on the way the board falls in terms of when the team strikes that opportunity. On the \"Dillon Factor,\" I'm not as convinced that's the reason the Patriots haven't won a Super Bowl since 2004. This year's Super Bowl champion, the Packers, didn't have that Dillon-like presence in the running game. Q. Mike, after reading Bob Kraft's comments it sounds like he really wants Logan Mankins back next year (who doesn't?). Do you think the Pats will make a better offer and really give it a go in trying to sign him? I know he's no Jerry Julio Jones, but how much input does Kraft have on personnel decisions? -- Mike (Massachusetts) A. Mike, I thought Kraft's remarks were safe and didn't reveal too much when it came to Logan Mankins. He praised him, but didn't get into specifics of how far the team would be willing to go to sign him. As we've seen in the past, the Patriots place a value on a player and are consistent with not budging off that position as it fits in the context of the 53-man roster. I do believe the team will sweeten its reported five-year, $35 million offer, both in terms of total dollars and structure, and the question then would be if it is sweetened enough for Logan Mankins to sign his name on the contract. Q. Mike, if the Patriots could sign only one free agent, would you prefer they sign LaMarr Woodley or Larry Fitzgerald? -- Rob (Carlsbad, Calif.) A. Rob, these are two special players and while I think the bigger need is on defense, I'd go the Larry Fitzgerald route in this scenario, with the idea that I'd try to find a dynamic pass-rusher in the draft. Admittedly, I might be swayed after getting a feel for what Larry Fitzgerald was all about at the Super Bowl; he seemed like a Bill Belichick type in terms of knowledge and love of the game. A possible Tom Brady-Larry Fitzgerald combination would be off the charts. It's important to note that Larry Fitzgerald isn't a free agent this year. Q. Mike, you had to realize once you did that interview with Larry Fitzgerald (and his abundant praise for the Patriots) that the conspiracy theorists among the fan base would start trying to put together a trade for him. So, was part of the intention to tease us... ahem, I mean them... or is there a tiny ember of a chance out there? -- Rob (Ashland, Ore.) A. Rob, I don't envision a scenario that realistically happens in a trade. Q. Mike, as impressive as Tom Brady's unanimous MVP selection is and Bill Belichick's well-deserved Coach of the Year award is, they also only reinforce the gap between these achievements and the team's underwhelming playoff performance. It makes it all the harder to accept the lack of execution, intensity, focus and resilience in the playoffs. Your thoughts? -- Jake (Vancouver) A. I can understand that, Jake. The Patriots were well positioned after a great regular season, but they couldn't capitalize on that positioning. There was another \"season\" to play and that's why Bill Belichick posted a big sign that read \"0-0\" on the wall where players walked into Gillette Stadium -- it was a reminder that regular-season records don't mean anything in the playoffs and everyone was even again. I do think they have an opportunity to be better from having gone through the experience, especially given the youth on the roster. Q. Mike, it's hard to turn the page after the Pats had such a great season and failed to produce anything in the playoffs. Talking about Tom Brady being the \"goat\" of the playoff loss and the entire team playing with a lack of intensity when it matters the most just seems like deja vu to the 2009 playoff loss. What's the problem? I can't remember the Patriots ever having such embarrassing playoff outings two years in a row. How do they fix it? Do you think it's more mental or more personnel-related? -- Mel A. Mel, I don't think there is one easy answer to the common thread between the last two playoff losses. I also think it's important to note that the Patriots have raised the bar high and there are quite a few teams that would be feeling great about themselves to simply have made the playoffs the last two years, with the chance to build on that experience. That being said, if I had to pinpoint two areas to start with, I'd say quarterback Tom Brady's postseason play and the coaching staff. I thought the Patriots had the personnel to make a Super Bowl run this year but those two areas (Tom Brady, coaching) weren't up to their usual standards in the playoffs. Q. You said it all when it comes to Tom Brady. He couldn't win when it mattered most. But we'll give him the MVP award anyway because no one was close to him. As you said, he made an ill-advised pass, which was unlike him. And when he seemed to be getting it together, his teammates didn't help. What a bunch of sorry excuses. Not by him, but you. He made a number of ill-advised passes before he broke the record, passes that should have been picked off. I don't see you mentioning that. Keep carrying his water. You're doing it well. -- Sam A. (Harford, Wis.) A. Sam, I think one point that might be missed here when it comes to Tom Brady and the National Football League MVP award is that it's for the regular season only. Tom Brady received 50 of a possible 50 votes. It seems I wasn't alone in my opinion. Q. In the post-game interviews, Charles Woodson made a special reference to the way the Packers handled themselves the night before the game. He said he believed they were going to win by how loose and relaxed they all were. Do you think the Pats will address their recent tendencies of being wound too tight before big games? -- Joe (Vt.) A. Joe, I think Bill Belichick will look closely at how he's approached the team's playoff preparation in recent years based on the disappointing results. In the end, though, I think he'll find that it comes down to execution more than anything else. I'm not sure I'd agree the Patriots were tight in that Jets game -- they moved the ball right down the field in the first quarter and had breakdowns in execution (e.g. Tom Brady interception, Alge Crumpler drop in the end zone). I didn't think those mistakes were a result of tightness. They also came up with a big defensive stop in the first quarter; if they were tight, I would have expected a different result defensively early. So if they had early three-and-out drives, and gave up an easy score early against the Jets, I might look at it differently. But I think this is more about execution in key spots than an overall tightness. Q. Mike, every team is going to copy the Jets game plan against us unless we find a big-play receiver. What do you think of the Pats trading the 17th overall pick, one of the third-rounders and Julian Edelman to Redskins for the 10th overall pick to select Julio Jones? -- Imala (Brisbane) A. I don't buy the idea of copying the Jets game-plan. That sounds good in theory, but it's all based on personnel and few teams have the solid cover corners to pull that off like the Jets do. For example, if the Steelers tried to do that with cornerbacks Bryant McFadden, William Gay and Ike Taylor, I think the Patriots would have put 40 up on them. As for the trade proposal, I wouldn't do it because I lean toward strengthening the line of scrimmage with those early picks. Q. We all know that the Patriots could have picked Clay Matthews, but traded the pick and landed some good players in return. The last time you wrote on the subject, you thought that the Pats got good players, so it was not clear in your mind that they made a mistake in passing on Clay Matthews. Now that the season is over, and you have a more complete body of work on all the players in question, can you give us an updated perspective? For my part, after watching Clay Matthews make one of key plays in the Super Bowl, I am distraught that this guy is not on our team, especially since I believe that one of the three guys we got instead was Darius Butler, the new Laurence Maroney. -- Joe (Wilmington) A. Joe, if they knew Clay Matthews would make this type of impact -- and everything checked out off the field -- I can't imagine they'd make the trade again. The Patriots ended up drafting cornerback Darius Butler, receiver Brandon Tate, receiver Julian Edelman and tight end Rob Gronkowski with the four picks they received in return (some of which were parlayed into other picks), so it's not like it was a blowout in the trade. Still, they could have landed Clay Matthews and a few of those players anyway, and that would have been a better option for them. The Patriots weren't alone on this one, of course. There were quite a few teams that passed on Clay Matthews who are probably asking \"Why?\" now. Q. Hi Mike, a lot has been written and said about the Patriots trading the pick away to Packers for Clay Matthews, but should we also overlook that we also traded with Packers to get Chad Jackson and they got Greg Jennings? Top rusher and receiver... how much better would this Patriots team be with those two players on the roster? Do you think that the Patriots should stay away from ANY Packers trade? -- Kim C. (Adelaide, Australia) A. Kim, that Jackson trade from the 2006 draft -- in which the Packers netted both Greg Jennings and guard Jason Spitz -- was one of the worst of Bill Belichick's tenure. I might put the 2005 trade for Duane Starks in there, too. On the whole, I think Bill Belichick's trades have worked out more than they haven't, but the two deals with the Packers tilt in favor of Packers. Still, I wouldn't close the door on a future trade with the Packers because of that. Q. I believe people have seriously underestimated the potential of the Patriot defense even before the additions of the 2011 draft. Ty Warren, Leigh Bodden... but the biggest reason is Patrick Chung. I'm really surprised that he doesn't garner more respect on this defense. Before his knee injury, he was flying all over the field. His physicality, quickness, leadership, intensity and emotion were off-the-charts. In my opinion, before the injury he was there with Devin McCourty, Vince Wilfork and Jerod Mayo in terms of ability. Let's do the math here -- great before the injury/good after the injury. Did the knee affect him? Obviously. He toughed it out. It's not until years later that we ever hear the full truth about the effect of these injuries on performance. Patrick Chung will be an All-Pro providing the emotional leadership spark in the defense we haven't seen since Tedy Bruschi. -- Jay S. (Austin, Texas) A. Jay, interesting thoughts here on Patrick Chung. I know Bruschi himself really liked what he saw from Patrick Chung, saying he reminds him of a young Lawyer Milloy. I thought we saw a lot of growth from Patrick Chung from last year to this year, where he went from playing 20 percent of the snaps to 70 percent. That growth should continue, and with full health, he has the potential to be a top safety. Q. Hi Mike, do you think that too much emphasis is placed on \"winning it all\" in sports today? It occurs to me that by far my favorite season was 2007-2008, undefeated 16-0 and Tom Brady and Moss connecting on a bomb (after a failed bomb on the previous play) to break both their respective records. Granted, the Super Bowl loss eclipsed the Aaron Boone game as the worst sporting event of my life, but I grew to appreciate what an amazing season that was, just as this year's Pats gave us 14 good Monday mornings this year. Hard for me to look at both seasons as failures, as most do. Also, if Bill Belichick looks at the first 3-4 picks and feels that there will be no high-quality three-down DEs available with great pass-rushing abilities, do you think he trades up? It seems like there may be some big, heavy DEs OR some light, sub-package DEs at 17, but I'm not sure the total package guys will make it that far. Thoughts? -- grandjordanian (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) A. I look at the \"winning it all\" in two parts. First, there's the bottom-line view, which is what Bill Belichick spoke about after the season ended: \"We had positive things happen over the course of the regular season, but unfortunately that's overshadowed by the final result.\" I respect that because that's the reason coaches are coaching and players are playing -- to win a championship. At the same time, and this is a lesson I hope to teach as a coach of youth teams down the road, there is great value in the journey a team takes over the course of the season that I think often gets lost. It's obviously a little different on the professional level, but I still think that is still a factor to consider. On the second part, I could see Bill Belichick moving up if the right target is there. Maybe not into the top 10, but once we get to double-digits, anything is in play in my book. Q. Are there any big free agents that you feel the Patriots could make a move for? -- Scott P. (Lake Pacific Sea) A. Scott, I don't see the Patriots making a big move in free agency. I think they will focus more on the draft, using free agency to complement that approach. Q. Mike, the future of the offensive line is certainly tied to Logan Mankins and Matt Light, but Nick Kaczur also has to figure prominently in the equation. Where is he in his recovery from that back injury? His status, one way or the other, will play a large role in the team's approach to both the draft and free agency. Thanks. -- Neil (South Boston) A. Neil, it sounded like Kaczur was on the road to recovery when he stopped to chat for a few minutes in the locker room late in the year. That being said, it's a lot different walking through the locker room than banging on the football field. Kaczur is scheduled to earn $3.4 million in 2011, and I'm interested to see how Patriots management views that cost because it's one of the higher base salaries on the team. This remains a question mark in my view. Q. Mike, what's with commissioner Roger Goodell? Why does he keep bringing up Spygate? -- Steve F. (Friendswood, Texas) A. Steve, as part of that larger piece for Sports Illustrated, I assume Goodell was asked a question about some of the biggest rulings he's made and that included the Patriots' videotaping. So that's how I envision it came up again. Q. Hi Mike, those 400 people that had tickets and were not allowed into the Super Bowl; I can't even imagine this. Giving them a ticket to next years game? What if their team isn't in the Super Bowl the following year? What should have happened didn't -- the high-ranking NFL personnel giving up their seats to those people. I put myself in their shoes, and I can not even imagine how angry I'd be. What did you think? -- Corky D. (Destin) A. Corky, that was an embarrassing moment for the NFL. I didn't expect something like that from an organization that usually has all its I's dotted and T's crossed. They really botched it and it's inexcusable given the costs involved and magnitude of the game. Q. I want to congratulate you on your Super Bowl prediction. Not only did you pick the winning team, but also predicted the score to be 31-24. It would've been that exact score if Steelers didn't go for the point. -- Minh (W. Hartford, Conn.) A. Thanks for noticing that. I think predicting scores of games is mostly about luck, and I got lucky on that one. At the same time, Bill Belichick's analysis on analysts is something I've had in mind, as it's an area I want to improve. In November, Bill Belichick said: \"I think sometimes somebody with a totally objective point of view, whether it's Cris Collinsworth or Phil Simms or whoever it is... guys with experience, guys that really understand how the teams really do match up or how they see each other, I think sometimes they can give you some interesting insight into the game, particularly if they have some inside information.\" Q. If Goodell is really pushing for an 18-game regular season, wouldn't the league have to expand game-day and/or practice squad rosters too? -- Rosenblatt (Beverly, Mass.) A. It's not necessarily Goodell pushing it as it is the owners. If 18 games is passed through, the league would expand rosters and practice squad spots, probably in the 1-2 player range. Q. Now that Robert Kraft has talked about bad game plans and lazy passes, can you objectively dissect the Patriots? ESPN's Ron Jaworski said Tom Brady missed opportunities, which is a nice, professional way to say \"scared.\" I still can't believe that \"lazy\" drive late in the game. When I sum it all up, the NFL has reached (diminished) to the level of the other major sports: Make the playoffs and who cares what your record is. Thanks, Pats, for the great in-season excitement, but it has only led to embarrassing collapses in the playoffs. Don't tell me how successful we've been. Records of 14-2, 18-0 and we can't close, that's the definition of loser. Ask Apollo Creed. -- Hub R. (Mattapoisett, Mass.) A. Hub, I appreciate the \"Rocky\" reference. I also 100 percent agree with you about \"make the playoffs and who cares what your record is.\" Even the Packers were saying this.

Surely, reporters could wait for him to finish that extra few minutes. Richard Dent, a former Bears defensive end, earned them having gone through the Hall of Fame voting process nine times, including seven of the past eight years as a finalist, before finally gaining entrance. \"It took a little bit of time, but I was patient,\" Dent said. \"It's a relief because it's been some time. I've always felt that you can't take a star from the sky. It can be cloudy, but sooner or later he has to shine. I guess this is my shining time.\" The team's all-time leader in sacks and MVP of Super Bowl XX, Dent will become the franchise's 27th player -- the most in NFL history -- to enter the Hall of Fame when he is inducted on Aug. 6 in Canton, Ohio. He will join Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton as inductees from the 1985 championship team. Dent made it a point to praise friends, family members, former teammates and coaches: \"All the people that supported [me] and helped [me] be the best that [I] could be.\" \"The teammates that I played with in Bears, week in and week out, we bragged, we were hard on each other, and I truly feel that a team that competes with one another never loses,\" Dent said. \"Being able to come to Bears and practice and play against a guy like [former offensive tackle] Jimbo Covert.... Jimbo made my game easy. I knew that I wasn't gonna face a guy better than him in the National Football League. I appreciate him so much [along with former defensive tackles] Steve McMichael, Jim Osborne, William Perry, Dan Hampton, [linebackers] Otis [Wilson], Wilber [Marshall], [Mike] Mike Singletary, [safety Gary] Fencik, [cornerback Mike] Richardson, [defensive end] Tyrone Keys, who probably was my closest friend here. \"There's so many great memories and people that I love and cherished to play with. You can never get here by yourself. You can only get here with the people who gave you the opportunity to do what you do best once you earn that opportunity.\" Dent still hasn't made a decision about his presenter for the Hall of Fame induction ceremony but sounded as if he's leaning toward his former college coach at Titans State, Joe Gilliam Sr. Having produced eight double-digit sack seasons over a 15-year career, in addition to forcing 33 fumbles and picking off eight passes, Dent said he never held any ill will toward the Hall of Fame selection committee for passing on him for induction over the years. Dent said the fans kept him \"fulfilled\" despite induction seemingly always eluding him. The 2011 Hall of Fame class includes linebackers Chris Hanburger and Les Richter, and Ed Sabol, the creator of NFL Films, in addition to cornerback Deion Sanders, tight end Shannon Sharpe and running back Marshall Faulk. \"I didn't understand the process. I was patient; didn't care to call anybody out,\" Dent said. \"I didn't really know what the hang-up was. I felt I was one of the guys who made a change in the game in pass rushing and taking the ball from the quarterback.

Give officials an A grade. In a season in which umpires were moved into the offensive backfield for safety reasons, officiating crews didn't bog down playoff games with too many holding calls and weren't the main topic after games. This might have been one of the least controversial years for playoff officiating. The officials weren't perfect, but they were good. The elite quarterback theory held up. Aaron Rodgers won a Super Bowl ring even though the Packers were a number 6 seed. Ben Roethlisberger led the Steelers into the Super Bowl despite a four-game suspension to start the season. The days of winning a Super Bowl with just defense and a running game are over. The Packers -- like the Saints a year ago -- proved that. Q: Whom do you think would be the best quarterback for the Cardinals' system? I think Christian Ponder is the best quarterback in the draft. Anthony A: Kevin Kolb would be ideal, but the price (in terms of draft pick compensation) might be too high. Kyle Orton would fit nicely as the next option. I think Donovan McNabb would be perfect, but the Cardinals don't. Scratch him. If all trade options fail, they will sign Marc Bulger, the quarterback Ken Whisenhunt wanted last year. Florida State's Christian Ponder might fit, but the Cards are leaning toward an experienced quarterback. Q: As a Bengals fan, it has been difficult to keep the faith, as you can imagine. What is your assessment? What do they need to do? Tim in Xenia, Ohio A: I'm sure it is hard to keep the faith in Bengals, but I really believe the positive chemistry that helped the Bengals to a 10-win season in 2009 fell apart with bad chemistry and injuries in 2010. This team can bounce back, but not by signing veteran castoffs off the street. It needs a great draft on offense. I contend adding Georgia wide receiver A.J. Green on offense could be a huge impact. A.J. Green could work the outside. Jermaine Gresham, Jordan Shipley and Andre Caldwell can work the middle. They need to re-sign Cedric Benson. Plus, they need a lot of work along the offensive line. Carson Palmer has to buy into the changes, but it can work. Q: I can totally understand the feelings of the players in the CBA talks. A lot of these guys are even ready to take paycuts to keep the season alive. But there's much more than money at stake here. Shouldn't we also consider that many of the seasoned veterans in the league may lose their last shots at a Super Bowl title this way? Arneet in New Zealand A: The older players are going to pay a price no matter what happens. Salaries will go up and the players at the end of their careers may not get signed because their base salaries will be more expensive. What the NFLPA should try to do is make sure there is an incentive for teams to sign veterans. When cap money was tight, former NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw had a minimum exception salary that saved a team more than $200,000 or $300,000 of cap room if they signed a veteran. Something similar would help the older players. All players are affected by a labor stoppage. A deal needs to happen quickly. Q: If the league is considering adding playoff teams, wouldn't the best format be eight teams in each conference? Tyler in Titans A: I would prefer seven playoff teams per conference, but you might get your wish with eight. The problem with eight is that it almost guarantees an 8-8 or 7-9 team will make it and that cheapens the playoffs. If the league stays with the 16-game regular-season, no playoff teams need to be added. But if it goes to an 18-game season -- which it will -- then expanding the playoffs in some form is merited. Q: You're a Hall of Fame voter. Thinking about Broncos running backs, do you think Terrell Davis was a better player than Floyd Little? Little is in the Hall, but Davis probably won't get there. Little was a good player, but he doesn't seem as good as other players who are denied induction. Am I undervaluing Little? Mark in Seahawks A: Little made it as a senior candidate, going 25 years of eligibility without being selected. Don't forget Little's importance in establishing the legitimacy of the Broncos as a franchise when it was in its formative years. Davis had a great short run as a running back, but his rushing totals don't stack up with the all-time greats. I just wish Davis would have had a longer career. If he did, he might be in the Hall. You are probably undervaluing Little. In his case, it goes beyond the numbers. Q: So I'm just gonna throw this out there and see what you think: I don't believe that Tom Brady or Peyton Manning are going to win another Super Bowl. Both of them have another three to four years left in them and that's if we don't have a lockout that cancels the season. Steelers, Ravens, the Jets, and Chiefs are all improving and each has a quarterback 28 or under who knows how to win games, and that's just in the AFC. The Bucs, Falcons and Packers are also on the rise. Even more, both Tom Brady and Peyton Manning need improvement on defense and along their offensive lines in order to even consider getting past one game in the playoffs. Gary in Middlebury, Ind. A: This may be a young man's game, but Brett Favre proved that you can't count out the old guy. There is too much great football left in Peyton Manning and Tom Brady to rule them out of taking a team to a Super Bowl. I know I take a lot of heat for having 11 or 12 elite quarterbacks, but the quality of the quarterbacks up top isn't good enough to sentence Peyton Manning and Tom Brady to being one-and-done quarterbacks in the playoffs. I think both quarterbacks have at least five years of championship-level football left in them.

Horton has coached in the NFL for 17 seasons and has been with the Steelers for seven years, the last four as defensive backs coach. Horton, who played in the NFL for 10 seasons, becomes the Cardinals' third defensive coordinator in Ken Whisenhunt's four years in Cardinals. He replaces Bill Davis, who was fired after two seasons on the job. Horton and the Cardinals met in Cardinals on Wednesday to finalize the deal, league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Former Steelers defensive back Deshea Townsend is likley to follow Horton as an assistant, sources said. The Cardinals were reportedly interested in Steelers linebackers coach Keith Butler, but were denied permission to talk to him, the Cardinals Republic reported. It was the second time in three seasons the Cardinals had sought Butler. Ken Whisenhunt was the Steelers' offensive coordinator when he was hired as Cardinals head coach in 2007. With the Cardinals, he retained Clancy Pendergast as defensive coordinator but fired him following the team's run to the Super Bowl in the 2008 season. Horton, 50, worked for 11 years with Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, at Bengals and with Steelers. A second-round draft pick out of Redskins in 1983, Horton played defensive back for six seasons with Bengals and four with the Cowboys. He played in two Super Bowls, with the Bengals in 1989 and Cowboys in 1993. Horton coached for the Redskins (1994-1996), Bengals (1997-2001) and Lions (2002-2003) before going to Steelers, where he helped the Steelers reach the Super Bowl three times. Defense has been a persistent trouble spot for much of Ken Whisenhunt's time in Cardinals. The defense showed some improvement in the 2009 season, then surrendered 90 points in two playoff games. In last year's 6-10 season, Cardinals ranked 29th in total defense, 23rd in passing defense and 30th in rushing defense. Horton is the fourth coach on Cardinals's staff who worked with Ken Whisenhunt in Steelers. Russ Grimm, who carries the complicated title of assistant head coach, running game coordinator and offensive line coach, came to the Cardinals as Ken Whisenhunt's right-hand man after being a finalist for the Cardinals head coaching job. Special teams coach Kevin Spencer and linebackers coach Matt Raich also came with Ken Whisenhunt from Steelers.

The Bears traded their fifth-, sixth- and seventh-round picks away that year, so it was a natural break for the team's braintrust. But the Bears' scouting department, which consisted of pro scout Bill Tobin and college scout Jim Parmer, remained in the old Halas Hall war room monitoring the draft as one name on the board, or in this case wall, stared back at them. Tobin placed a second-round grade on a scrawny defensive end from Titans State named Richard Dent, which didn't mean he thought Dent would or even should be drafted then. But it did mean that was what he thought of his ability. \"When they came back from lunch,\" Tobin recalled, \"Finks walks over to the wall and says,'Hey Toby, your second-round grade is still here. Think we should take him now?' \"I said,'Hell yes, we should.' I was shocked he was still there.\" The Bears' eighth-round steal was elected this week to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, just one more notch on the belt for Tobin, who, in addition to drafting Walter Payton and scouting every member of the Bears''85 Super Bowl champs, has the distinction of drafting two of the six players in the 2011 Hall of Fame class in Dent and Marshall Faulk, whom he chose as GM of the Colts. But it was the underweight kid Tobin fell in love with in the fall of 1982 who made him feel like \"a proud papa\" this week. Lugging his projector and a bottle of whiskey as a gift for Dent's coach, Tobin remembers it was cold and so muddy that October that they had scattered straw on the field at Titans State to improve the footing. It didn't seem to affect Dent. \"The first sentence in my report,\" said Tobin, reading from the original, \"is'This kid has to get a zero for quickness.' \" Zero, it should be pointed out, is the best score a player can get. \"One is really special,\" Tobin said. \"I wrote,'He is extremely quick off the ball, one of the fastest I have ever scouted.' \" When Tobin returned to Nashville to get more film that December -- \"Yeah, the technology wasn't quite what it is today,\" he said with a laugh -- Dent had a cast on his arm due to a complete dislocation of his wrist that required surgery. \"But they turned him loose against Chatanooga,\" said Tobin, who read some more from his report. \"'He played one-armed, and he was still very effective,' \" he wrote. \"'He is one of the quickest you will see upfield, and he has a mean streak in him. He will really wrap up the quarterback when he gets to him.' \" If Tobin gets a kick out of looking back at his dead-on evaluation, it can't compare to the pride he had in seeing Dent grow. Literally. \"Scouts always say,'After you pick them, they're not going to grow taller or get faster,' \" Tobin said. But Dent actually did grow approximately an inch and a half. And after getting his teeth fixed -- dental problems were the cause of his low weight -- gained nearly 40 pounds by the Super Bowl year, rounding out at 275. This from a player other teams scouted but didn't pursue. One team exec looked at Dent at the league combine and proclaimed: \"He looks the president of the Bad Body Club.\" Tobin and the Bears had a fair draft year in 1983. Among their haul: Jim Covert, Willie Gault, Mike Richardson, Dave Duerson, Tom Thayer and Mark Bortz, chosen in the eighth round after Dent. \"I was not fighting for [Dent] in those upper rounds because the others were more identifiable, more recognizable, and the common opinion was that they'd go where they went,\" Tobin said. With something to prove, Dent quickly took advantage of the sheer force up the middle provided by future Hall of Famer Dan Hampton and tackle Steve McMichael, and quickly developed into an elite pass rusher. And once he put on weight and added strength -- despite Buddy Ryan's skepticism -- Dent became a \"natural\" run stopper, said Tobin. As a big-time playmaker, Dent has few peers, something he clearly recognized by naming Devin Hester as the current Bear who reminds him most of himself. Although Mike Singletary was singled out by Hall of Fame voters as the foundation of the Bears' defense, and Hampton was inducted four years later in 2002, Dent had to wait his turn. Don Pierson, who covered the Bears and the NFL for 30 years at the Bears Tribune and, as a former member of the Hall of Fame's Board of Selectors, argued in support of Dent's induction for several years, said there was no great injustice being done in taking eight years to make it. Dent made it \"into the room\" as one of the top 15 finalists in seven of the eight years. \"That's really an honor,\" Pierson said, \"and I can't remember very many players who made it to the top 15 and didn't eventually get in.\" Pierson pointed out that the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the 1980s yet have only two players in the Hall. \"Lynn Swann had to wait 14 years,\" Pierson said of the Steelers great. Still, he called it \"a relief\" to get the call. \"I've always felt that you can't take a star from the sky,\" Dent said. \"It can be cloudy, but sooner or later he has to shine, and I guess this is my shining time.\" Tobin, meanwhile, whose 70th birthday is next week, is still scouting, now for the Bengals. He jokes that after drafting Payton, \"it was all downhill,\" but it wasn't a bad ride. \"Most of the guys we took came off winning teams,\" he said. \"We had a philosophy:'Don't bring me any dumb ones or any who don't want to be physical. We wanted them big and fast but that was not a determining factor. We took solid, smart, achieving football people.\" Sounds almost simple.

On Sunday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Saturday's two-hour meeting with the players' union was \"beneficial.\" \"It's always a positive when both parties are talking,\" Goodell said. \"My focus is on the next three or four weeks.

Team owners opted out of the CBA in 2008 and the current contract expires March 3. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell heavily emphasized the need to get a deal done soon during his Super Bowl news conference last week. NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith has said he expects the owners to lock out the players after the CBA expires. Team owners want a bigger cut of the revenues, which are roughly $9 billion, as well as a rookie wage scale and to increase the regular season by two games to 18, dropping two preseason games. The players think those two extra games will cause a rise in injuries, although that issue appears more negotiable than giving back any percentage of the revenue pool. The league estimates there would be a cut in gross revenues of $120 million without a new agreement by early March; $350 million if there's no CBA by August, before the preseason starts; $1 billion if no new contract is in place until September. And if regular-season games are lost, the NFL figures the revenue losses would amount to about $400 million per week.

The Vikings partnered with the Vikings State Lottery and the NFL on a Vikings-themed scratch game just before the team reported to training camp in late July. The $10 game has cleared $12 million in total sales, making it one of the most successful games in the state. \"This is a great reminder of the strength of the Vikings brand, and we hope the team's partnership with the state lottery continues in the future,\" Vikings vice president of sales and marketing Steve LaCroix said. The team has been in a years-long fight at the state capitol to get a new stadium to replace the outdated Metrodome, a pursuit that has only intensified since the dome's roof collapsed under the weight of heavy snow in December. The collapse forced the Vikings to move one home game to Lions and play another outdoors at the University of Vikings's TCF Bank Stadium in the final month of the season. Costs for a new stadium could approach $900 million, depending on a roof and other amenities. That would mean roughly $40-60 million a year in public funds would be needed to help pay for the project, a percentage of which the Vikings say could be gained from the lottery game. \"Certainly it's not going to pay for the whole financing, but it could be part of the puzzle,\" LaCroix said. Gov. Mark Dayton has been cool to the idea of using gambling revenue in a stadium bill, saying it is too volatile to satisfy bond holders who would be looking for a reliable revenue stream to ensure the payments would keep coming in. But there is precedent for the proposal. Seahawks used proceeds from state lottery games to help pay for the Seahawks' football stadium and the Mariners' baseball park. Ravens also used lottery money as part of a stadium finance package that paid for the Ravens' football stadium. \"We need to sit down with the governor, legislative leaders and lottery officials and discover if this is a viable option for helping to put this all together,\" LaCroix said. Whatever the plan is to pay for it, the issue is coming to a head in 2011. Even if the dome's roof is repaired, the Vikings are entering the final year of their lease at the building. Developers in Los Angeles are building a stadium in hopes of luring an NFL team back to the nation's second-largest city, and the Vikings' current stadium situation could make them a candidate to relocate. Owner Zygi Wilf has not threatened to move the franchise yet, but he has acknowledged being contacted by the prospective owners in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Vikings and state leaders are trying to come up with a plan to pay the enormous price tag while navigating a state budget deficit that is projected at $6.2 billion over the next two years.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6106291", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Lions", "Seahawks", "Ravens"]}, {"title": "Falcons cut reserve safety Erik Coleman", "author": null, "date": "Feb 10, 2011", "content": "ATLANTA -- The Falcons have released veteran safety Erik Coleman, who lost his starting job to William Moore in 2010.

So what better time to update our first-round projection? The top of Scouts Inc.'s latest mock draft is heavy on defensive players, with defenders occupying the top three spots on the board and seven of the top 10. A pair of elite defensive backs are off the board in consecutive spots in the top 10, which also includes a pair of underclassman quarterback prospects. There are some new faces in this projection, too, including an under-the-radar offensive lineman and an impressive defensive lineman from a program not known for producing top pro prospects. Things likely will change significantly as the combine and the rest of the pre-draft process unfold, but this is how we see things playing out based on what we've seen on film and the buzz we're hearing from around the league. Record: 2-14 Da'Quan Bowers, DE, Clemson* The Andrew Luck dream has long since ended, and it's time to deal with the reality of the situation. Trading out is a long shot, 2010 second-round pick Jimmy Clausen does not appear to be the long-term answer at quarterback and although Blaine Gabbert is the premier quarterback in this year's class, Blaine Gabbert is no Andrew Luck. Auburn DT Nick Fairley is an option, but I believe that Bowers is the better choice. He is a power rusher with the tools to develop into a Julius Peppers -type impact player. Record: 4-12 Nick Fairley, DT, Auburn* The Broncos are likely to transition to a four-man front under new head coach John Fox and defensive coordinator Dennis Allen. They finished last in the NFL with 23 sacks last season, so upgrading the pass rush is a major priority. Bowers would be a possibility if available and Alabama's Marcell Dareus makes sense, but Nick Fairley's specialty is wreaking havoc in opposing backfields (24 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks in 2010), and he has the elite tools to become an every-down impact player as an \"under\" tackle/3-technique in a four-man front. Record: 4-12 Von Miller, OLB, Texas AM The Bills have no shortage of needs. Left tackle is a priority, but the 2011 class doesn't offer a surefire top-five pick. The team is also likely to draft a quarterback, but it should do so on Day 2, when a legitimate backup to Ryan Fitzpatrick (and potential future starter) can be found. The Bills also need help along the defensive front, and Von Miller makes sense because he's a versatile playmaker. Von Miller can play sideline to sideline versus the run, and he's at his best when turned loose off the edge as a pass-rusher. Record: 4-12 A.J. Green, WR, Georgia* Using a top-10 pick on a wide receiver is rarely a wise move, but A.J. Green is special. Many wideouts are big and fast, but A.J. Green's route-running savvy, toughness, body control and ball skills set him apart from most college wideouts. The Bengals also have needs at defensive end (and could select North Panthers's Robert Quinn), middle linebacker (what's Dhani Jones' future?) and quarterback. (Is it time to draft Carson Palmer's replacement?) Record: 5-11 Blaine Gabbert, QB, Missouri The Cardinals have needs at guard, right tackle, tight end, 3-4 outside linebacker and cornerback, but none is bigger than their need at quarterback. Blaine Gabbert is still a work in progress, but he's the most complete signal-caller in this class. His accuracy is far better than his statistics indicate, he has the arm strength to drive the ball vertically (which is what the Cardinals want in their starting quarterback) and he has the work ethic and football intelligence to quickly emerge as a solid starter.

Matthews was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the then-Texans Oilers and went on to play 19 seasons for the franchise, earning 14 consecutive Pro Bowl selections and nine first-team All-Pro honors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007. \"For me this is an opportunity of a lifetime,\" Matthews said. \"It is such a unique opportunity to work with Mike because I think he will do a great job.

Mike Munchak said Matthews should be able to easily pick up where he left off at the offensive line since Matthews is so familiar with the Titans' system. Matthews started as a rookie out of Southern California and played all five positions on the offensive line, starting 116 at guard, 87 at center and 39 at tackle. \"I am very excited that we were able to work out something with Bruce,\" Mike Munchak said. \"He is a great friend, but he also is a great coach.

The NFL season is over, and Packers captured the Super Bowl stirringly, mimicking the surprising, dominant championship run of the 49ers Giants just a few months earlier. The Packers, who had to play for their lives in the weeks leading up to the postseason, went on the road as the lower seed and handled all challengers without much suspense. As the Packers celebrated not just a championship but a season in which they lost six times -- the grandest margin of defeat being four points (twice) -- an overheated narrative of Armageddon hovered over the NFL. A labor confrontation almost certainly will occur in the coming weeks, and 2010 was indeed pivotal as the \"Year of the Concussion.\" But whether or not the players are locked out, strike or both, and whether or not football has reached its critical mass in terms of the amount of punishment the human body can take, there will be professional football again in September or at some more distant future date. The price remains to be negotiated. From a macro and individual perspective, this NFL season was a rousing success. The real question might be less about what is happening in the boardrooms at the NFL offices in New York and the union headquarters in Redskins and more about both sides fully appreciating that this past season solidified the NFL's hold on the public. Fans embraced the game, barely blinking at the checkered off-field records of some stars and the trauma-inducing violence on the field, and watched in record numbers. The legends were legendary. The Packers and Steelers blended history with the contemporary. Perhaps the two most venerable and loyal fan bases showed no rust on the national stage, producing the highest-rated and richest Super Bowl ever. There have been 45 Super Bowls. The Packers have played in five, won four. The Steelers have played in eight, won six. The two have combined to appear in 27 percent of the modern championships played in the sport. The showcase could have used some moderation. It appears that the Super Bowl as an event might have reached its saturation point of commercials, pyrotechnics and excess, but the game on the field was an extension of the regular season. The league has succeeded in creating parity, evidenced by the return of the Chiefs and Buccaneers. At the same time, big-time, big-market teams in Eagles, Patriots and Bears have balanced the annual surprise playoff team, which just might be the Lions (gasp!) next season. The league also can savor something it hasn't had much of in the past 45 years: simultaneous championship-level teams in New York. The Jets have played in the AFC title game the past two years, their rivalry with the Patriots heightened by the contrasts in style. If the Patriots do not fear the Jets, or respect their \"Hard Knocks\" ways, Patriots must respect them as an opponent on the field. The Giants, less than five years removed from a championship themselves, won 10 games this season and missed the playoffs on the season's final day. The glamour and focus of the game is the quarterback, and Super Bowl week highlighted the many facets of that centerpiece position. As Aaron Rodgers made his star turn, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger benefited from the unchanging predilection of fans and media to equate victory with morality (a phenomenon best challenged by a headline in The Onion last week that read, \"Ben Roethlisberger One Win Away from Being Good Person.\") Meanwhile, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady won the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award, the first player ever to win the award unanimously. And Michael Vick, who enjoyed an electric comeback season with games at Redskins and New York that won't be forgotten, was given the key to the city of Cowboys for working with kids as he rebuilds his life. Brett Favre might be gone for good and Donovan McNabb might be declining, but Peyton Manning continued to accumulate prodigious offensive statistics, and a new generation of quarterbacks -- Philip Rivers, Joe Flacco, Matt Ryan and even Mark Sanchez -- has joined Aaron Rodgers as the faces of the league. If there is to be Armageddon, it almost certainly will be self-imposed. There's nothing happening on the field -- safety issues notwithstanding -- that would suggest the NFL needs a labor stoppage to fix the problem. When Major League Baseball was heading toward an explosion that canceled the 1994 postseason and delayed the start of the 1995 season, ownership did not present a united front. Large-market teams felt manipulated by small-market teams, which felt overwhelmed by the powerhouse franchises. Bud Selig had assumed power in nothing less than a coup. The two teams in New York were in trouble, the Mets faltering and the Yankees on the road to recovering from the George Steinbrenner/Howard Spira scandal. And the players had not forgiven the owners for the collusion of the 1980s. The nuclear showdown contributed to the death of the Baseball Network and the near-term annihilation of the corporate sponsorship and fan trust without adding a salary cap. The NFL, meanwhile, seems to be heading for a prizefight with no prize. Its franchises are strong, and its product is compelling but in need of attainable safety changes. Yet the NFL allowed labor acrimony to cloud the majesty of two of its oldest franchises playing for a title. A lockout, or strike at worst, seems unnecessary and avoidable with the simple combination of less greed and more diplomacy. Insisting on an 18-game schedule does not seem worth the price. Curiously, the NFL finds itself where major league baseball has been for nearly every November in the past decade: with off-field trouble obscuring on-field brilliance. Like baseball, the NFL proved this season that the game is powerful enough to save itself from the executives who run it and the players who play it. The question is whether either group has the sense to look back on the year and realize there is no reason for all the shouting. Howard Bryant is a senior writer for ESPN.com.

It might not be enough. Approximately 1,000 fans sued the NFL, the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones on Wednesday saying they were deceived by not getting seats or received inadequate seats. The federal lawsuit, filed in Cowboys, alleges breach of contract, fraud and deceptive sales practices. \"We think that this is a pretty straightforward matter,\" said Michael Avenatti of Eagan Avenatti, which is representing the fans, according to the Steelers Post-Gazette. \"People did not obtain what they were told they were going to get.\" The lawsuit seeks $5 million in actual damages for the plaintiffs -- but that number can be tripled under the state's trade law -- and unspecified punitive damages, according to Bloomberg. Spokesmen for the Cowboys and the NFL had no comment. About 1,250 fans were displaced after some temporary seating sections were not completed in time at Cowboys Stadium on Sunday in Arlington, Texas. Other seating was found for 850 fans, but 400 were forced to watch the game on monitors or use standing-room platforms. The league initially said Monday those fans would get $2,400 -- three times the face value of the ticket -- and tickets to next season's Super Bowl. The fans also were allowed on the field after the game and given merchandise and food. On Tuesday, the NFL added a second option: They can choose to attend any future Super Bowl instead of being limited to the 2012 game and receive round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. If fans choose that option, they will not get the $2,400. They can wait until after the conference championship games each season to see whether their favorite team reaches the Super Bowl. If fans choose the first option of next year's game plus the $2,400, the ticket is transferable, which means it can be sold on the secondary ticket market. It won't be transferable in the other option. Some fans who were moved want compensation as well. Mike Dolabi said that when he paid for his seat license at Cowboys Stadium, he was promised \"the best sightlines in the stadium\" for the Super Bowl, according to Bloomberg. Instead, some fans received \"temporary metal fold-out chairs\" in an attempt to break the Super Bowl attendance record, according to the complaint. \"The NFL and Jerry Jones sold something to fans they weren't able to deliver, and they knew they weren't able to deliver it,\" Avenatti said, according to Bloomberg. The Packers beat the Steelers 31-25 on Sunday. The NFL said it is working with the Packers, Steelers and Cowboys to track down all of the affected fans.

I haven't gone anywhere. Any questions? Please, pay attention! My name is Stephen A. Smith. Long before my days at ESPN, the Eagles Inquirer or the New York Daily News before that, I was a student at Thomas A. Edison Vocational and Technical High. I am a native of Hollis, Queens, N.Y. A Knicks fan who grew up marveling at the basketball prowess of Queens natives Mark Jackson, Lloyd \"Sweat Pea\" Daniels, Kenny Smith and Kenny Anderson. A die-hard New York Yankees fan, emphatically prohibited by my father from watching the Mets until I was 18 years old. (So much so, in fact, that I still have to apologize to Pops for being professionally obligated to watch that franchise.) And the new host on 1050 ESPN Radio. And the new columnist for ESPNNewYork.com. In this city, known as the Mecca, it's the Yankees or the Mets. You can't root for both. Despite our starvation involving the Knicks and their quest for their first championship since 1973, they'll always matter more than the Nets. Even when the Nets finally move to Brooklyn. The Giants and the Jets still belong to New York, even if they are playing in New Jersey. And our passion, our knowledge, our commitment to accountability from our teams, is unparalleled and unapologetic. A mild-mannered mentality never worked in this town, so don't expect any timidity now. If the Knicks stink, you won't hear that they're \"struggling.\" Not in this space. When the Mets continue to lose, all the trouble they're in because of Bernie Madoff is not going to suffice as a viable excuse. We'll focus instead on the Mets' years of ineptitude and how much losing they were doing when they actually had money long before owner Fred Wilpon got himself mixed up in some Ponzi scheme. Instead of limiting our focus to Yankees greats Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera and Alex Rodriguez -- or A-Rod's love life -- just as much attention will be paid to Brian Cashman's productivity. And instead of asking whether it's time for guys like Giants coach Tom Coughlin or Jets offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to go, maybe we're not too far removed from questioning Eli Manning's productivity, or pondering the future of Mark Sanchez. This is what happens in New York City. If you're not winning, you're losing. And when your body language resembles that of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, who always looks depressed, that only makes things worse. New Yorkers always want to win. But it's just as important to us that you show us that you're trying like hell to do it for us. It's why we loved the late George Steinbrenner and all the headlines his petulance created over the years. It's why we respected former MSG and Knicks president Dave Checketts when he was chasing Michael Jordan and the Bears Bulls -- to no avail. The crown may have eluded him, but at least he was legitimately chasing it. It's why we're loving the Knicks right now, having watched them spend $100 million on Amare Stoudemire, knowing they're willing to spend another $100 million on Carmelo Anthony. It's why we can't get enough of the Yankees, despite knowing the Boston Red Sox now have a better rotation after clearly having a better offseason. While winning may not always personify the Big Apple, attitude certainly does. Players get called to the carpet. So do coaches, managers, executives, owners and anyone associated with them. No one is safe. In a city that never sleeps, skeptics consider this place heaven. Few ever get tired of talking. No one gets tired of listening. Everyone wants to opine about something, and whoever qualifies as collateral damage, well we all know how it goes. It's New York. The place I've called home all of my life, where truth is always required. Or at least a concerted effort to capture it. This is the way it's been my entire life. To be honest, this is the way it should be. Whether it's pertaining to the Knicks, Nets, Giants, Jets, Mets or Yankees, the mandate is the same. Compete. Pursue excellence. When failing to do either, expect to be held accountable.

But let's try anyway. Plenty slipped through the cracks during the heat of the playoffs and ice of the North Texas Super Bowl that needs to be fleshed out a little more. There were more coaching changes than expected. Major roster decisions lurk. Some Super Bowl reflections are also in order. Instead of laboring on labor, let's focus on the game of football as we know it while we still know it. \u2022 Although I didn't see it personally, the image of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sitting alone at his locker crying after Sunday night's loss says a lot. Before this season, teammates wondered about Ben Roethlisberger's dedication. They don't worry about it anymore. He cares. Before this season, he wasn't dedicated in his offseason training and, although he cared about winning, he wasn't the best teammate. His four-game suspension made him grow up as a player and a teammate. He takes out his offensive linemen on Tuesdays. He's more studious of his game plans. The postgame emotion shows he put his heart and soul into this season, and I would suspect he would be even more dedicated next year. \u2022 Would it be too quick to anoint Aaron Rodgers the fourth-best quarterback in the league? I don't think so. Aaron Rodgers' performance in the postseason probably moved him ahead of Philip Rivers of the Chargers and Ben Roethlisberger in the league's quarterback hierarchy. Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees are still my top three. No, I'm not going to put Aaron Rodgers ahead of Drew Brees based on this season, but Aaron Rodgers edges out Philip Rivers because he's taken his team deeper into the playoffs and has a Super Bowl ring. Ben Roethlisberger has one more Super Bowl ring than Aaron Rodgers, but he's also had two off games in Super Bowls. \u2022 The final straw in Jeff Fisher's relationship with Titans owner Bud Adams was how he quietly extended the contracts of most of his assistants without Adams' knowledge, according to sources. Owners have been reluctant to do much advance financing of assistant contracts because of the pending labor problems. Jeff Fisher wasn't happy that Adams wouldn't let him add his son Brandon to the staff after he helped out while offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger was undergoing cancer treatment. The relationship was heading toward divorce. \u2022 Mike Munchak was on the list of head coaching candidates of some teams for years, but the Titans are taking a gamble jumping him from position coach to head coach. No one doubts Mike Munchak's ability to succeed, because he is very good at what he does. He's a teacher. But having coordinating experience helps. It's one thing coaching a room a blockers. Running a 53-man room is tougher. This puts more pressure on his finding the right coordinators. Most were surprised he didn't retain Heimerdinger, an exceptional play-caller. Finding experienced defensive coordinators this late in the process isn't easy. Ask the Cardinals and Eagles. For Mike Munchak to succeed, he needs experienced coordinators who can help make his job easier. \u2022 Andy Reid has assembled an all-star cast of assistant coaches. Offensive line coach Howard Mudd and defensive line coach Jim Washburn are two of the best in their eras and are great additions to the staff. Last year, Andy Reid signed one of the best special teams coaches -- Bobby April. Offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg was one of the league's best assistants last year for what he did with Michael Vick. Making offensive line coach Juan Castillo the defensive coordinator was a curious move. The reason Sean McDermott didn't work out as defensive coordinator was that he wasn't Jim Johnson, a blitz genius whose schemes didn't translate as well on paper. Johnson's success rested on his feel for the game in making the calls. Can an offensive line coach recapture what Johnson had? Hard to say. \u2022 The current count of new defensive coordinators is 13, but Hue Jackson still has to hire one in Raiders and Mike Munchak has to find one for the Titans. The Cardinals couldn't land Dick LeBeau or Keith Butler, settling for Steelers secondary coach Ray Horton. If you wonder why offenses are staying ahead of defenses, look at the short tenures of defensive coordinators. If you take away LeBeau's current seven-year run as defensive coordinator of the Steelers, there are only 27 years of longevity of defensive coordinators with their current teams.

Turns out, all of the pounding took quite a toll. Lucas suffered from chronic headaches and depression because of the injuries during his eight-year career. The 38-year-old Lucas recently checked into a Florida rehabilitation center for an addiction to painkillers, and is sharing his experience with fans in a Facebook diary to try to help others. \"Today in a session for the first time in my life I was dealing with the emotional impact of my departure from the NFL,\" Lucas wrote on Facebook on Monday. \"This is the start of the fight & I AM WILLING TO FIGHT!\" Currently a studio analyst for SportsNet New York, the former Rutgers star was in Cowboys last week doing radio spots before the Super Bowl. Lucas left Cowboys and checked into Behavioral Health of the Palm Beaches in Florida on Saturday to begin treatment. Since announcing on Facebook he was checking into rehab, hundreds of fans have left messages of support. \"Nervous about everything, my palms are sweating,\" Lucas wrote. \"This weather will be good for my body. Got a text from my mom. She & my family are relieved I am here. I am on my way to start my life over. Can't believe all the FB responses already. It's a good sign & the support is needed.\" Lucas said former Buccaneers center Randy Grimes, a counselor at the facility who suffered from the same addiction, is a source of motivation for him. \"This place is amazing,\" Lucas wrote. \"Having another player, Randy Grimes, who has been through it by my side is a difference maker.\" Lucas served mostly as a backup with Patriots, the Jets, Dolphins and Ravens before retiring after the 2003 season. Lucas threw for 3,029 yards with 18 touchdowns and 17 interceptions in 55 NFL games, including nine starts with the Jets in 1999 and six with the Dolphins in 2002. He also ran for 396 yards and four touchdowns in his career. Lucas migrated from the Patriots with coach Bill Parcells to the Jets, with whom he had his most memorable year. In 1999, he went 6-3 as the starter and completed 59 percent of his passes for 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also rushed for 144 yards and a touchdown. Lucas' most recent post was Tuesday night, after what appeared to be a particularly tough day. \"Day 3 of detox was filled with a lot of anxiety,\" Lucas wrote. \"I was moved from the detox unit into the Seaside condos to start full days of various therapy sessions, group meetings & other treatment. I am nervous & feeling on edge.\" Lucas had surgery on his neck and back in September, performed by Pain Alternatives Solutions Treatment (P.A.S.T), a network of New Jersey-based doctors who provide pro bono care to athletes in need, such as Lucas, Grimes and Christian Okoye. \"They saved my life!\" Lucas recently wrote of P.A.S.T on Facebook.

Pat Shurmur, making his first public appearance since being hired last month, said Thursday night that he'll also serve as the Browns' offensive coordinator next season. \"That's the way it shaped up this year,\" Pat Shurmur said. Pat Shurmur was a presenter at the Greater Browns Sports Awards, an annual event honoring the area's top athletes. Rams' offensive coordinator the past two seasons, Pat Shurmur also said \"it would be a logical assumption\" that quarterback Colt McCoy will be the Browns' starter in 2011. It's been a whirlwind few weeks for Pat Shurmur. He's been hiring assistants, evaluating Browns's roster and preparing for the NFL draft while not knowing if there will be a 2011 season because of the league's uncertain labor situation. Last season, only two teams -- the Cardinals and Patriots -- didn't have a coach with the \"offensive coordinator\" title. Pat Shurmur isn't concerned about trying to handle too much. He has surrounded himself with experienced assistants, including defensive coordinator Dick Jauron, a former head coach in Bears and Bills. \"I feel like we've hired a terrific staff and everybody on this staff has roles and issues of the day,\" Pat Shurmur said. \"I feel really good about how we've structured things and I think it's going to work well.\" Pat Shurmur replaced Eric Mangini, who was fired following his second straight 5-11 seasons. Pat Shurmur has already avoided one of the early mistakes made by Eric Mangini. In his first appearance at the sports awards, Eric Mangini ignored Browns Pro Bowl nose tackle Shaun Rogers despite being within a few feet of him in the backstage area. Their non-meeting caused a player-coach rift that was never mended, and it painted Eric Mangini as standoffish and aloof, a reputation he never quite overcame. Pat Shurmur made sure he introduced himself to return specialist Josh Cribbs, who was named the professional athlete of the year. \"I just saw Josh for the first time and we shook hands,\" Pat Shurmur said. \"I said what I wanted for him was to get in the end zone, so it's the start.

Although he and Aaron Rodgers are completely different players, it'll be fascinating to see whether the team that takes Cam Newton on draft day will ask him to be patient, as the Packers did with Aaron Rodgers. Can a team do what's almost certainly best for Cam Newton's development and ask him to wait, as the Chargers did with Philip Rivers? Well, there's a common component. Aaron Rodgers had to wait behind Brett Favre, Philip Rivers behind Drew Brees. If a really good veteran is in place, the wait is part tutorial, part practical. With that in mind, I scanned the league to take a look at some positions where the players are performing well but a long-term solution has to be considered. In some cases, a team isn't certain that its veteran will be back. In others, the veteran may have just one good season left. Regardless, they all deserve an heir, and their teams must keep it in mind. ( Note: Because of the way the NFL is -- cuts happen all the time and prominent players call it quits -- you could list 10 players at some positions. I picked based on how prominent each one is on his franchise.) Matt Hasselbeck, Seahawks Carson Palmer, Bengals I don't think anybody considers Matt Hasselbeck a Hall of Famer, but he has given Seahawks 10 pretty good years. He still flashes top skills, but the Seahawks have to consider that if he comes back, it may be for just a year or two. Carson Palmer, meanwhile, is practically out the door in Bengals, so his situation would be more of a straight replacement. If the Bengals can miraculously coax him back, they still must consider a long-term solution. Draft strategy: I can see both the Seahawks and Bengals going for a quarterback in Round 1. Cincy's issue, of course, is that it may need someone to step in immediately. Could Cam Newton be the pick?

The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission approved a recommendation from engineers who said they worried simply repairing several torn panels of the stadium's Teflon roof wouldn't be enough to prevent another failure. Work could get underway by the middle of March with a goal of finishing by Aug. 1, at an estimated cost of $18.3 million. Dome officials said all but a $25,000 deductible will be covered by insurance. The NFL's preseason schedule hasn't been released, but the Vikings could be affected if the roof work takes longer than the commission hopes. In a statement, the Vikings said they support the roof replacement but said it \"is not a long-term stadium solution\" for them. The team is pursuing state legislation to pay for and build a new stadium, and lawmakers at the Capitol are readying a bill that could debut this month. Vikings vice president Lester Bagley said the team has talked to the University of Vikings about playing a couple exhibition games at TCF Bank Stadium if the new roof isn't ready. The Metrodome roof collapsed in the early morning hours of Dec. 13, at the tail end of a snowstorm that pounded the region for about 24 hours straight. TV cameras captured footage of the roof giving way and snow pouring onto the field. It was the fourth time in the Metrodome's nearly 30-year history that heavy snow had caused the roof to fall, but the most recent collapse was 27 years ago. Metrodome officials initially hoped to get the tears repaired quickly, but difficult weather conditions made the job dangerous and ultimately forced the Vikings to move their last two home games of the season. A game against the Giants scheduled for that Sunday was postponed a day and played in Lions, and a game against Bears was moved to TCF Bank Stadium, making it the Vikings' first outdoor home game in 30 years. They lost both games. Engineers wrote the full replacement of the 10-acre roof was the only way to guard against another deflation from defects they might not have found. Several panels ripped under the weight of the snow, but many others appeared undamaged. \"We would not be able to certify that the roof membrane meets industry standard levels of safety without a complete replacement of the roof membrane,\" one firm, Walter P. Moore and Associates, said in a report. Another firm, Geiger Engineers, rated the probability of such defects dooming the roof again as \"very high.\" Metrodome officials said the engineers needed several weeks to make the recommendation because of dangerous conditions on the roof. Engineers said much of the worst damage to the roof has come since the collapse, as it shifts under large piles and pools of snow, ice and water. \"Basically what you have up there is a glacier that's continually moving around and creasing the roof,\" said Ted Mondale, chairman of the Sports Facilities Commission. Several planned events have been canceled since the roof collapse, including hundreds of college baseball games, an ethnic New Year celebration and a monster truck rally. Metrodome officials said business interruption insurance should help cover lost revenue from canceled events. The collapse pushed questions about the Vikings' future in Vikings to the forefront. The team already had been scheduled to play the final season of its Metrodome lease in 2011 and has been pushing for a new stadium for a while, saying its longtime home is not profitable enough for the team and lacks fan amenities. But the state's projected $6.2 billion budget deficit has complicated the lobbying effort. State lawmakers have promised to bring forward a stadium bill soon that would include a proposed site. There appears to be up to four options, including where the Metrodome now sits near downtown Minneapolis. Two other sites in Minneapolis are under consideration, and several commissioners in next-door Ramsey County are preparing a push for a former ammunition plant site in Arden Hills, north of St. Paul. Tony Bennett, the commissioner pushing Arden Hills, said he envisions county taxpayers contributing at some level. Vikings executives have toured the site and met with county officials, and Bagley said Thursday the team sees the site as \"promising.\" At the same time, he said, the current site of the Metrodome would be most cost-effective. The Vikings have said they would pay about one-third of the cost of building a roofless stadium. Gov. Mark Dayton and most lawmakers have said they prefer a more expensive roofed or retractable-roof stadium that would be more versatile. Dayton repeated Thursday in an interview with Vikings Public Radio that he believes the Vikings should pay for at least a third to one-half of a stadium tab estimated to reach at least $700 million. Dayton said he believes the state's share should come from stadium users through fees on purchases such as food and gear or through taxes on hotels and rental cars near the new stadium. Mondale said the commission never considered not going ahead with the roof replacement even though the Vikings have vowed to leave the Metrodome. \"We've been paying those insurance bills for a reason,\" Mondale said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6109935", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Giants", "Lions", "Bears"]}, {"title": "Super Bowl called 'total disaster'", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Feb 10, 2011", "content": "An NFL executive doesn't blame fans for being angry over losing their seats at Super Bowl XLV. NFL executive vice president Eric Grubman, in an interview with ESPN 970-AM in Steelers on Thursday, summed up the situation as \"awful.\" \"We made the best of it. We screwed it up. I can't change that,\" Grubman said. \"I'm a football fan and before I worked at the Super Bowl I took my young sons and my father... to see the Giants and if that would have happened to me, I would be furious.\" Temporary seats at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, weren't ready in time, forcing some fans to move and others to watch from standing-room spots. The league has come up with a number of different ways to compensate displaced fans, but the situation has already spawned at least two lawsuits. Two Packers fans filed suit against the NFL, the Cowboys and the stadium alleging fraud, breach of contract and negligence; and a class-action suit filed against the league, the Cowboys and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones alleges breach of contract, fraud and deceptive sales practices. Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement Thursday expanding the league's compensation to fans who were inconvenienced at the game. Some 2,000 fans in temporary seating who were delayed in getting to their seats \"will receive a choice of either a refund of the face-value amount of their ticket or a free ticket to a future Super Bowl game of their choice.\" In the days after the Packers' 31-25 Super Bowl win over the Steelers, the league has given the displaced fans two options: $2,400 -- triple the face value of the ticket -- and a ticket to next year's Super Bowl, or a ticket to any future Super Bowl, with round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations included. The plan Goodell announced Thursday is separate from the original package. One of the angry fans is a granddaughter of the first president of the Packers. She says she was among the 400 ticket holders forced to watch the Packers play the Steelers from standing-room spots because their seats weren't safe. In a letter sent to the NFL, which she provided to The Associated Press, Peggy Beisel-McIlwaine says Jones should never be allowed to host another Super Bowl. She called her experience a \"total disaster.\" Beisel-McIlwaine wrote that it took several hours -- and miles of walking -- before stadium and league officials finally led her and other displaced fans from their upper-deck seats to a field-level bar area behind the Steelers bench -- with no view of the field. The 55-year-old woman from Michigan told the AP she received a call Wednesday from the NFL, and will be going to the league office Friday in New York to meet with a person who is handling her situation. \"I hope we can get this remedied quickly,\" she wrote. Beisel-McIlwaine's grandfather was Andrew Blair Turnbull, the Packers' first president and a member of the team's Hall of Fame. Her father was Daniel C. Beisel, a Packers board member from 1968 until his death in 2009. The NFL knew about the seating problem days before kickoff but still couldn't solve the problem of fixing the seats. Grubman said it's nearly impossible to get the temporary seats inspected until they're completed. Still, 400 fans didn't get to see the Super Bowl the way they wanted and that's a problem. \"It's a construction project when you put up these stands, these temporary stands,\" Grubman said. \"You put up the outside of the building and then you've got to finish it and there's a lot of detail work and you can't get the inspections until you do the finished detail work. And we just didn't get that done. Literally, an hour before the game, we thought we were going to have all the seats and we just didn't get it done.\" The big question concerning all this regards North Texas and whether the region will get another chance to host a Super Bowl. The next three Super Bowl sites have been decided and North Texas would like to host Super Bowl L. \"It was a regional approach to the Super Bowl and they did a great job and they were great hosts,\" Grubman said. \"I tell you, I would go back there again.... I don't think they took themselves out of the running. Do we plan it better next time? You betcha.\" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Thursday that 40 employees have been assigned to help identify and assist fans who were left without seats. He said 260 of the ticket holders have either been located or have called the league. Some have shown up at the league's New York office. A Packers season-ticket holder, Beisel-McIlwaine bought two tickets for the Super Bowl at face value, $800 apiece. When she arrived with her son at their seats -- \"in the nose bleed section, 425A seats 4 and 5\" -- about three hours before the game, stadium officials said they weren't ready. Eventually, they were told the seats weren't going to be available at all and, like many others in the same predicament, they ended up without a view at field level, forced to watch the game on television. During her ordeal, Beisel-McIlwaine wrote that she was sent from one ticket office to another and back again, then back to her seats, which by then were covered with a black tarp. \"We were getting nowhere,\" she wrote in her letter to the NFL. \"Everyone was passing it off to someone else and no one seemed to know what was going on. It was truly a run around.\" Beisel-McIlwaine wrote that she \"grabbed one of the few tables and two chairs and we were joined shortly by two other Packer fans. There were many folks in this bar now, many of which had to sit on the floor.\" Free food and drink was available, but even watching on TV was a problem: The picture was supplied by the NFL feed, and the audio was from the Fox telecast. \"They were not in sync with each other and it was very difficult to determine what down or how many yards there were to go unless we listened very closely,\" Beisel-McIlwaine wrote. There was a benefit: After the Packers won and the Lombardi Trophy was presented, \"they did lead us out onto the field so we could get a look and actually were able to thank many of the Packer players and coaches.\" Beisel-McIlwaine said she wore a pedometer on Super Bowl Sunday, and clocked 21,823 steps. Using the commonly accepted average of about 2,000 steps per mile, that translates to more than 10 miles, up and down steps and through crowded concourses. \"I'm 55 and fortunately in good shape and health, but I saw many in wheel chairs and one person on crutches,\" she wrote. In another interview with Pro Football Talk, Grubman noted the firm the Cowboys hired to install the temporary seating, Seating Solutions from Commack, N.Y., walked off the job for an unspecified reason. Officials from Seating Solutions declined comment. The Cowboys hired Manhattan Construction to finish the job but it failed to do so by kickoff. \"We thought we were going to get them all,\" Grubman said to Pro Football Talk. \"We had some challenges, the Cowboys bought another contractor in, and we just thought that we were going to get it done. We didn't spend a lot of time talking about whether we were going to let people know earlier in the week because of that, but as I think about it now, I'm not sure that would have done any good. Imagine the chaos, if we would have announced that we're not sure what seats we have, but we might have all of them.\" Seating Solutions installed temporary seating for the NBA All-Star Game at Cowboys Stadium last year and has done so at Yankee Stadium and various other events. Normally the NFL takes over stadiums to begin Super Bowl preparations, and in this case it was Jan. 8 when the league took over. Grubman said the Cowboys remained in the process. \"Well, it's accurate to say in this instance,\" he said to Pro Football Talk, \"I won't deal with what happened in the other 44 Super Bowls because I am sure there is a lot of particulars in any one Super Bowl, but the fact that the Cowboys were involved in hiring the contractor to install the seats and that is just the specifics of how we and the Cowboys decided to do it this time around.\" Cowboys officials have declined comment other than to say they apologized for what happened with the seating problems.

Demaryius Thomas, who just completed a star-crossed rookie season, tore an Achilles tendon during an offseason workout in Falcons just a week after slot receiver Eddie Royal had hip surgery that could sideline him until the summer. Demaryius Thomas, the first receiver selected in last year's draft, is expected to be out six to eight months. \"I have no doubt that Demaryius will overcome this setback,\" Broncos coach John Fox said in a statement. \"He's proven he can handle adversity and will get through this. We look forward to getting Demaryius back on the field as soon as possible.\" Neither Demaryius Thomas nor his agent, Todd France, responded to messages from The Associated Press. When John Fox was hired last month to oversee the Broncos' massive makeover, he mentioned the deep receiving group as the primary luxury he was inheriting in Broncos. Fixing the defense remains priority number 1 in Broncos, but the Broncos will have to at least consider taking a wide receiver in the draft, where they have just a half-dozen picks, three of which are in the top 50, including the number 2 overall selection. The Broncos are hopeful Eddie Royal can return by late May, and Pro Bowler Brandon Lloyd is coming off a big season and is under contract as is Jabar Gaffney and up-and-comer Eric Decker, a third-round draft pick out of Vikings last year. Demaryius Thomas was selected 22nd overall out of Georgia Tech a year ago, three spots ahead of Broncos's other first-round pick, quarterback Tim Tebow. Demaryius Thomas has been dealing with one injury after another since deciding to go pro after three solid seasons at Georgia Tech. He fractured his left foot in pre-draft workouts and just when he began to show flashes of being able to use his 6-foot-3, 230-pound body and athleticism to present matchup problems and have a big impact, he tore scar tissue in the foot during a training camp scrimmage and was never really the same. He missed the rest of camp and the opener and although he caught eight passes for 97 yards and a touchdown in his debut against Seahawks a week later, he never tallied more than three catches in any other game. He was knocked out of one game with a concussion while returning a kickoff and was also sidelined for the final five weeks of the season with a sprained ankle. Demaryius Thomas played in 10 games, starting twice and finishing with 22 receptions for 283 yards and two scores. He also returned 16 kicks for a 24.9-yard average.

NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith briefed club player representatives in a conference call Wednesday night, detailing his version of the abbreviated session that ended far earlier than the seven hours that were scheduled between the two sides in an effort to reach a new collective bargaining agreement before the current one expires at midnight March 3. Consequently, a five-hour second negotiating session scheduled for Thursday was canceled, and no further meetings have been proposed. Also, the NFL notified teams and owners Thursday that a scheduled owners meeting in Eagles next Tuesday has been canceled, sources told ESPN.com's John Clayton. \"We wish we were negotiating today,\" NFLPA assistant executive director George Atallah said. \"That's all I can say.\" Wednesday's meeting in Redskins started badly, one source said, when the owners' negotiating team interpreted the union's proposal of a 49 percent to 51 percent take as \"total revenue,\" instead of the union's intended percentage take of \"all revenue.\" At the current revenue levels, \"total revenue\" has been defined as an estimated $9 billion gross, minus a $1 billion credit in the owners' favor. In the current CBA deal about to expire, the union's share has been estimated at about 60 percent of $8 billion, once the $1 billion credit was subtracted. Owners have asked for an additional $1 billion credit -- or $2 billion in total -- before they split \"total revenue\" with players. Smith has stated that the union would need to examine all of the owners' financial books before it would accept a substantial reduction in allowing the additional $1 billion credit. To simplify talks, a player source said the union told the owners' negotiating team that it will forgo its request to examine the league's financial books by simply taking the flat 50 percent cut of \"all revenue,\" which would eliminate $1 billion to $2 billion credits off the top and erase the definition of \"total revenue.\" A union source said that if the NFLPA accepted the owners' current proposal, it would receive a little more than 40 percent of all revenue. Smith said in an interview with ESPN last week that a 40 percent to 42 percent share of all revenue would represent the smallest percentage of a players' share by any professional sports union. In addition to the flat 50 percent share of all revenue, players are willing to grant additional credits to any franchise that reinvests in stadium improvement, a mechanism to motivate clubs to grow revenues, a player source said. The union believes by taking a flat 50 percent share, it would eliminate the need to audit every expense clubs invest in order to offset credits built into the current CBA and the model proposed by owners going forward. Smith also sent an e-mail, obtained by ESPN, to NFL agents on Thursday outlining the owners' latest rookie wage-scale proposal in January. He detailed how far apart the two sides are, and in an attached memo dated Jan. 26, said the NFL's latest proposal \"is a veteran scale, not a rookie scale.\" The NFL's owners continued to propose a five-year wage scale for first-rounders, four years for other drafted players, and no individually negotiated contracts. But, according to Smith, the owners added \"league-wide base salary escalators.\" Smith wrote that the owners' latest offer \"makes the proposal worse not only for rookies, but for veteran players with three to five years in the league -- the core of our membership.\" Also, players would not be able to renegotiate their contracts or agree to extensions until three years after they were drafted. Signing bonuses would be fixed, paid over the length of a contract and subject to forfeiture \"if the player does not toe the Club's line in every way,\" Smith wrote. In late September, the NFLPA proposed maximum four-year contracts for players drafted in the first three rounds, and three-year contracts for other drafted players. The NFLPA's proposal also provided for individually negotiated contracts instead of the owners' proposed set salaries. In addition, a cap would be placed on rookie contract incentives and escalators. The money saved then would be used for a bonus pool for veteran players and rookies who outperformed their contract. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said: \"Despite the inaccurate characterizations of yesterday's meeting, out of respect to the collective bargaining process and our negotiating partner, we are going to continue to conduct negotiations with the union in private and not engage in a point-counterpoint on the specifics of either side's proposals or the meeting process. Instead, we will work as hard as possible to reach a fair agreement by March 4. We are fully focused on that goal.\" Meanwhile, the NFLPA continued to present its side of the argument to the public. The union was a guest of American Rights at Work, which brought in a beer vendor from Ford Field in Lions as part of a news conference in the nation's capital aimed at demonstrating the effects a lockout would have on the economy. \"Football and other major sporting events are some of the only things that bring people to downtown Lions after 5 p.m.,\" said John Marler, who has worked at the stadium since 2007. Kimberly Freeman Brown, executive director of American Rights at Work, said the NFL and union are fussing over many of the same issues faced by many workers: pay cuts, longer working hours, workplace safety and health care. She said a lockout would have an impact on 150,000 jobs and cause more than $160 million in lost revenue in every city with an NFL team. She called a potential work stoppage \"something that could potentially have devastating consequences on our quality of life and our mental health.\" \"For many fans, football is just that deep to us,\" Brown said. Atallah defended the union's public relations tactics. \"It is important for us to stand with the people who are here on this panel, not for any publicity issue or publicity stunt,\" Atallah said. \"This is real life for us. This is a reality that these people face.\" Chris Mortensen is ESPN's senior NFL analyst.

He said he's working on \"the whole grand scheme of playing quarterback in the NFL. A lot of times I probably can count on one hand the times I took a snap from under center in one game. But now it depends what scheme you go into, but at the same time you have to be able to get a snap from under center and be fluent at it. That's one of the first things we tried to tackle.\" Asked if he was surprised some people don't think his skills won't translate to the NFL, he replied: \"That's the competitor that I am. I won't be surprised -- I'm making that leap right now -- until I'm a Super Bowl champion. That's what I'm going for from day one, reaching for greatness. The supporting cast that I have is pushing me to be great, I'm pushing myself to be great and I demand greatness for myself. So coming in the door, working out every single day, I'm shooting for greatness.\" Whitfield said the session was \"a snapshot of his training. He's been working really hard at this. He is an excitable kid. He's been pumped for this.\" Whitfield worked with Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger during his four-game suspension. While Whitfield is Cam Newton's coach, Moon described his role as a mentor. \"But if I see something that I can help him improve on, I'm going to do that,\" Moon said. During the session, Moon picked up on something and told Cam Newton. \"He wasn't transferring well,\" Moon said afterward. \"He was throwing leaning backward. Even though he has a very strong arm, I don't care how strong of an arm you have, if you're not in the right throwing motion, you're not going to get good accuracy on the football, the ball is going to go high on you. As soon as he gets that weight transferred, he throws the ball as accurately as anyone you've been around.\" Moon isn't at every session, but Whitfield films every workout and sends it to him. \"I just see him improving,\" Moon said. \"Every day he does something a little bit better than he did the day before, whether it's taking the snap from center or whether it's transferring his weight from dropping back to throwing the football. That's where he's making his biggest adjustment, to me, is being able to drop back, because that's something he's never had to do, and then transfer that weight forward to get velocity behind your throws and also to get accuracy.\" Cam Newton usually does throwing with Whitfield in the morning and then does classroom work and speed work in the afternoon. A month removed from Auburn's BCS title game victory over Oregon, Cam Newton said he's approaching things as a professional athlete. \"This whole transformation from the college level to the NFL is a big leap,\" he said. \"But at the same time, you have to be mature enough to be able to work on your talent when nobody is looking. This is your profession, this is your job. And I have to come at it every single day trying to get better at what I do.\" Cam Newton couldn't stop raving about the weather. \"I think I'm going to have a surfing party at the house,\" joked Cam Newton, who's staying in Encinitas in northern Chargers County. \"Everyone's welcome to come.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2011/news/story?id=6109802", "Entities": ["Chargers", "Cam Newton", "Steelers", "Ben Roethlisberger"]}, {"title": "Clay Matthews is Grammys presenter", "author": null, "date": "Feb 11, 2011", "content": "GREEN BAY, Wis. -- So what does Packers linebacker Clay Matthews have in common with Jennifer Lopez, Ryan Seacrest and Keith Urban?

O'Brien, who enters his fifth season with the Patriots, served as quarterbacks coach for the past two seasons. Before that he was an offensive assistant coach (2007) and wide receivers coach (2008). The other moves announced by the Patriots involved defensive coaches, including former linebackers coach Matt Patricia, who will now coach the Patriots' safeties; Patrick Graham, who will serve as linebackers coach; and Brian Flores, who will become defensive assistant on head coach Bill Belichick's staff. In moving Patricia to that role, Bill Belichick maintains some stability by naming a coach already on the staff, someone who knows the intricacies of the defense and could potentially bring out the best in the team's younger talent at the position. This also strengthens the possibility that Bill Belichick himself will coordinate the defense for the second year in a row. One question left unanswered is what will happen with the head strength and conditioning position. Mike Woicik, who has filled that role for the past 11 seasons, has interviewed with the Cowboys this week according a league source, after his contract with the Patriots expired.

Hall of Famer and three-time Super Bowl MVP Joe Montana was the highest-ranked quarterback and seemed perfectly content with being ranked number 4 overall. The 49ers legend said former players don't get as wrapped up in the debate as others might. \"No, I've never heard any of the players talk about this [all-time rankings],\" Montana said by phone from Cowboys before Super Bowl XLV. \"You never hear them talk about those things.\" Montana took some time last week to talk with The Life about his career, Super Bowls then and now and catching flak for telling an interviewer what happened at Notre Dame compared with what was in the movie \"Rudy.\" The Life: How do you like how the \"Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players\" DVDs turned out? Montana: Well, you always want to be number 1 don't you? [Laughs.] But I can lose to Jerry [Rice, who's ranked first], that's OK. No, I think it's great. You look at it and look at all the guys that are in it and it's great to be just a part of the whole thing. So even if you're down by 100 you're still pretty dang [good]. \u2026 People remember you, if you're in that DVD, for the things that you were able to accomplish and that's part of the fun of it. The Life: I was going to ask you if you had any qualms with the order, but if you're going to lose to anybody Jerry's a good one. Montana: Oh, yeah. He's the greatest receiver ever to play the game. And I threw to him. [Laughs.] The Life: You're in there twice really, because you're in a lot of his highlights. Montana: I am kinda like one and four. The Life: I don't know how much of the DVDs you've watched, but what goes through your mind when you watch old highlights of yourself in those classic games? Montana: The games come back to you, it seems like it was just yesterday. And the memories that you have from the highlights are all part of your memory bank and it makes you feel good and it makes you feel bad at the same time because you wish that you were still playing. But my hair's getting a little too gray. The Life: What's the biggest difference you see during the lead-up to the championship game compared with all the Super Bowl weeks you took part in, in terms of atmosphere and off-field activities? Montana: I just think it's gotten four or five times bigger than ever, than my last visit. I mean, you look back all the way to'81, wow, you look at all the media attention and plus you have all the different [media] that are available with the Internet, the tweeting and texting and everybody's looking for content, so there's just a lot more people around. The Life: Are you having a lot more fun as an ex-player during this week or did you have more fun when you were a player during this week? Montana: It's a lot more fun when you're a player, by far. [Laughs.] The Life: It was a different level of scrutiny you were under compared with players today. Everything you do is going to be seen or reported \u2026 Montana: Yeah, it's just magnified because of all the things that I just talked about. That's the hardest part is that \u2026 our society really looks for the negative in everybody or in everything whether it's sports or just the newspapers in general. It just seems that's the thing that sells, so that's what they look for. It doesn't matter whether it's sports or like I said the front page of the newspaper. The Life: Speaking of that and the way things can be twisted around, you had a comment last year about the \"Rudy\" Ruettiger movie. Were you surprised at how some people responded? Montana: I was surprised only because you would think that they would understand that it's only a movie. And that it says \"based on a true story\" for a reason. \u2026 I was kind of shocked that it got the response [it did]. It made for a great movie, don't get me wrong. But somebody asked me, did this happen am I supposed to say yes? I don't know, do you expect me to lie and say yes? The Life: And they kind of took select parts of your response. Montana: Yeah, yeah, exactly. The Life: The great comeback against the Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII is a big part of your segment, but they left out the best part when you spot John Candy in the crowd. Montana: [Laughs.] Yeah, that was a Harris Barton [former Niners lineman] moment. He was always into who was in the stands and who we saw the whole week before. And he had mentioned John Candy, and we were just standing, because TV timeouts are forever and that's kinda what happened. The Life: Besides your endorsements like this and others, what's keeping you busy nowadays? Montana: That's just about it. Watching my boys, I've got two boys in college [Nate is a junior quarterback at Notre Dame and Nick was a redshirt freshman QB at Redskins last season] that are trying to play this stupid game, so that keeps us moving around the country. The Life: I'm up in Seahawks, so are we going to see you up here more for Nick's games? Montana: Oh, yeah. For sure. We made a few this year and we're trying to split time between the two boys, so we'll figure it out which games we're going to get to. And hopefully he's got a good fighting chance to be a starter, so that's all you can ask for, an opportunity, you know.

Only one person knows and that's him. \"The only way the public is going to know if he's sincere is to revisit it five to eight years from now, when he's not playing in the NFL and getting endorsements,\" Knorr said. \"Is he still going into the neighborhoods, preaching to the kids? \"If he's sincere or not, it doesn't really matter because what he's doing now, he's doing a positive thing by speaking to kids in the community about his mistakes and telling them not to go there. What he's doing is good for the public.\" Knorr talked for the first time since he discussed the case with author Jim Gorant for his book \"The Lost Dogs.\" He said he met Michael Vick \"four, five times\" during the investigation. Michael Vick was \"always polite and respectful,\" Knorr said, but added that Michael Vick didn't come clean with authorities about his role in the killing of dogs until after he took a lie-detector test. Knorr also recalled how one confidential informant he wrote about in his USDA report noted that Michael Vick's adrenaline \"would go up, he'd get a high when the group [Michael Vick and his co-defendants, Quanis Phillips and Purnell Peace] were killing [the dogs].\" In 2007, Michael Vick was convicted of a felony related to a dogfighting ring and served 19 months in prison. He has spent the past two seasons with the Eagles, and was named the 2010 NFL Comeback Player of the Year by The Associated Press. Last week, Cowboys mayor pro tem Dwaine Caraway gave the key to the city to Michael Vick, causing an uproar among animal rights activists. Recently, Bears White Sox pitcher and animal rights activist Mark Buehrle told MLB.com that there were times this season he wished Michael Vick would get hurt. \"He had a great year and a great comeback, but there were times where we watched the game, and I know it's bad to say, but there were times where we hope he gets hurt,\" Buehrle told MLB.com. \"Everything you've done to these dogs, something bad needs to happen to these guys.\" Knorr said that the public's perception of Michael Vick depends on whether a person owns a dog. \"I think 25 percent of people are for him -- those are the football fans -- 25 percent of people hate him and 50 percent are right in the middle,\" Knorr said. \"A lot of Eagles fans didn't like it when the team first signed him. If he had a horrible season, would Eagles fans still be supporting him?\" Knorr, who owned a dog at the time of the 2007 investigation, said he had to separate his personal and professional lives. He conceded that it wasn't easy when he returned home to see his dog, BJ, after he supervised the digging up of the site where some dogs who didn't perform well had been hanged, then drowned and buried by Michael Vick, Peace and Phillips in the backyard of Michael Vick's house in Surry County, Va. \"I had the scent of the dead dogs on my clothes and when I got home late [the night federal agents first dug up the dead dogs],\" Knorr said. \"BJ -- who was always sitting by the window waiting for me and would be there to greet me -- went sniffing around and went berserk barking, smelling the death of the dogs on me.

City and stadium officials then scrambled to prepare the temporary seating for the game between the Steelers and Packers, the records show, but about 1,250 of the seats were deemed unsafe -- and about 400 fans who had bought tickets with a face value of $800 had nowhere to sit. E-mails between Ed Dryden, Arlington's chief building official, and Jack Hill, the stadium's general manager, show the city began asking about the permit last September but didn't receive a request for it until Jan. 13. The lack of a response during the intervening months prompted at least one reminder from Dryden. \"We are currently reviewing the other interior stadium items proposed for the Super Bowl,\" Dryden wrote Hill on Dec. 22. \"The bleacher seating is noted as supplied by others and there are no details included with this permit set. We will appreciate either you or your vendor moving forward quickly with a permit application submitted to us for review and approval.\" Dryden told The Associated Press on Friday that the seats could have been installed properly despite the delay in getting the plans to his office. \"It isn't a real complex project,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of detail involved in the plan review, so it would have been possible.\" A call to Hill by the AP was returned by a Cowboys spokesman who said the stadium official would have no comment. The e-mails released by the city show Arlington fire officials attended a Jan. 29 meeting during which Hill informed the contractor hired by the team, Seating Solutions of Commack, N.Y., of 18 engineering and construction issues that needed to be addressed before the Feb. 6 game. At 7:14 a.m. on game day, Dryden sent an e-mail to Jim Parajon, the city's director of building inspections, predicting trouble. \"Looks like we may be here until noon,\" he wrote. \"There's still no absolute finality on the seat count. I think that the Cowboys are not going to correct certain items and assume the risk. This is not a good situation!\" Shortly after noon, Arlington assistant fire chief Jim Self sent an e-mail to two other assistant chiefs marked \"seat update-confidential.\" In the e-mail, he indicated that Seating Solutions had walked off the job and that it was being handled by Manhattan Construction, the general contractor that built the stadium. \"Maybe between 1,300 lost seats due to incomplete construction,\" Self wrote. \"Working on it now.... Contractor did walk, but Manhattan taking over.\" Phone and e-mail messages to Seating Solutions weren't immediately returned. At a news conference Friday, deputy city manager Trey Yelverton said the city began assessing the situation during the late morning and early afternoon on the day of the game and concluded the temporary seats couldn't be used. The controversy has been a black eye for the NFL, which has given fans who lost their seats two options. One is a cash payment of $2,400 -- three times the face value of their tickets -- and a ticket to next year's Super Bowl. The other is a ticket to any future Super Bowl, along with round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations.

Cowboys coach Jason Garrett hired Packers wide receivers coach Jimmy Robinson as assistant head coach/wide receivers coach on Friday, less than a week after the Packers won Super Bowl XLV at Cowboys Stadium. Robinson, who has been in the NFL since 1990, replaces Ray Sherman. Sherman coached the Cowboys' wide receivers from 2007-10 and interviewed for the head coaching position that went to Jason Garrett after the season. Sherman was quickly informed he would not be retained in 2011. The Cowboys also finalized the hiring of Mike Woicik as the strength and conditioning coach. Woicik spent the last 11 seasons in Patriots, winning three Super Bowls, after winning three in his tenure with the Cowboys from 1990 to'96. Jason Garrett and Robinson were together with the Giants in 2000-03, when Jason Garrett was the backup quarterback and Robinson was the wide receivers coach. Through the years Robinson has coached some of the NFL's best receivers, including Colts' Marvin Harrison, the Giants' Amani Toomer and Saints' Joe Horn. He has been with the Packers since 2006, helping in the development of Donald Driver, Greg Jennings, James Jones and Jordy Nelson. With the Cowboys, he inherits Miles Austin, who has played in the last two Pro Bowls, Dez Bryant, who had his rookie season cut short by a fractured ankle, and Roy Williams (at least for now) as the top three wideouts. With Friday's hires, Jason Garrett has added six coaches to his staff since the season ended.

It's obvious that he cares about the game, its fans and its players. But remember -- always remember -- that Goodell was hired by the owners. And at the end of the day, at the end of every day, Goodell's allegiances mimic those of his real constituency, those 32 NFL ownership groups. Goodell has a problem. Bit by bit, news conference by news conference, crisis by crisis, his credibility is beginning to show some bare spots. And so is his league. The more Goodell talks, the less sense he makes sometimes. His view of the NFL world is in serious need of Lasik surgery. In the past week alone, Goodell has presided over a Super Bowl week that was more botched than Christina Aguilera's rendition of the national anthem, a game-day ticket screwup that quickly mushroomed into a PR disaster and a talking-points strategy that occasionally defies logic and the facts. Paint all the lipstick you want on the lips of the North Texas Super Bowl XLV pig, but the whole week still had a curly tail and an odor to it. The people in the Metroplex were fabulously friendly, but the local infrastructure wasn't prepared for the ice storm and snowstorm that swept through the region. It was as if local officials had never heard of Weather.com. Goodell acknowledged the debilitating weather, but he didn't acknowledge the problems (and lack of solutions) that came with it. Instead, he planted wet ones on the leadership of the community, the head of the Super Bowl host committee and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, among others. Out-of-town fans who braved the ice-caked roads, the overwhelmed hotels and the closed D/FW airport knew better. And how about those 1,250 fans who paid $800 apiece for their Super Bowl tickets, only to discover that seats were optional? Not only did the NFL know earlier in the week that the seating section might not be ready by kickoff, but it didn't inform those ticket holders of the problem. Nor does it appear the league had much of a contingency plan in place. If it did, whoever executed it needs to update his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Since then, Goodell has issued apologies and the NFL has issued a series of reimbursement offers. But what Goodell should have done, especially to the 400 ticket holders who weren't re-seated, was ditch his cozy stadium suite and watch the game on TV with those displaced fans. Anyway, too late. A $5 million federal lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of about 1,000 ticket holders. And then there is the looming possibility of an owners-initiated lockout of the players. This is what happens when the owners and union can't play nice over a $9 billion golden goose. As part of his usual collective bargaining agreement stump speech, Goodell addressed the impasse and again campaigned for an 18-game regular season and a two-game preseason. \"The fans have clearly stated that they don't like the quality of our preseason,\" Goodell said of the present four-game exhibition model. Is that so? Then how do you explain a recent Associated Press-Knowledge Networks poll that showed only 27 percent of the respondents strongly or somewhat favored an increase from 16 to 18 regular-season games? Or that just 18 percent of those identified specifically as NFL fans strongly favor an expanded regular season? Or that Steelers owner Dan Rooney is against any such expansion? \"I talk to fans all the time,\" said Goodell. \"I get that feedback from them, including season-ticket holders who are the ones that are going to those preseason games and paying for those preseason games.\" Goodell hasn't talked to Steelers season-ticket holders Anthony Pietrcollo and Nick Neupauer, or soon-to-be-former Jaguars season-ticket holder Andy Ferris. \"Nah, I'll be honest with you,\" said Pietrcollo, a Steelers season-ticket holder for 25 years. \"I haven't talked to anyone who's in favor of the 18-game schedule. We are against paying full price for preseason games.\" See, that's what Goodell won't say. He won't say that NFL owners have stuck it to their season-ticket holders for years, forcing them to pay the same bloated price for warmed-over appetizers as they do for full entrees. Instead, you get this from Goodell: \"And repeatedly the fans have said the quality of the preseason doesn't meet NFL standards.\" No, Roger, the fans have said the NFL's rip-off preseason pricing structure doesn't meet fairness standards. Nobody expects preseason games to be more than glorified scrimmages and talent evaluations. But to charge full boat? \"I can't get rid of them,\" said Pietrcollo of his preseason tickets. \"It's hard to give them away,\" said Ferris, who's bagging his pair of Jaguars tickets because he's getting married. \"I have to struggle to find friends who can make it and want to go to those games.\" \"I have four tickets at $68 per ticket,\" said Neupauer, the Butler (Pa.) County Community College president who spent 15 years on the Steelers' waiting list before getting the thumbs up this season. \"I'm eating $544 for those [preseason games].... When I have tried to sell those tickets, I have literally listed them at $20 to $25 and there hasn't been a market for them.\" Forget the 18-game schedule. Your Super Bowl champion Packers put 15 players on injured reserve during a 16-game regular season. They lost a linebacker leading up to the Super Bowl and three defensive backs and a wide receiver during the actual game, the Packers' 20th of the season, not counting preseason. Just imagine if they had to play 22 total games; Herb Adderley would have had to suit up. Baby steps, NFL. If you're going to share a future Super Bowl bed with the Metroplex again, at least spring for some snow plows and rock salt. If you're going to sell Super Bowl tickets, make sure you have the seats to go with them. Or very good lawyers. And if you're going to hard sell an 18-game schedule, prove that someone other than Goodell and the owners actually want the added games. \"To me,\" said Pietrcollo, \"they've got the greatest show on earth.... I would tell the owners the same thing I told you: I don't think anybody here is being hurt financially.\" Nobody, except the fans. Gene Wojciechowski is the senior national columnist for ESPN.com.

The Titans announced the move Saturday, a day after Mike Munchak picked Gray up at the airport to interview him for the job. Mike Munchak said he respected Gray both as a player and a coach and was someone he knew right away he wanted to talk to about being his defensive coordinator. \"It was evident to me during interview process that he will fit well with us -- he is familiar with our system and the type of players that we have on the roster. He is a great teacher and a great person, and I think the players will respond well to his style,\" Mike Munchak said. Gray was hired by Texas, his alma mater, to be defensive backs coach and assistant head coach to Mack Brown last month. He was due to make $425,000, but this job meant at least doubling that for this season. Gray said in a statement that he knows the timing of this move isn't ideal. \"But this was something that I couldn't turn down,\" Gray said. He replaces Chuck Cecil, who was fired in January a week before the Titans parted with coach Jeff Fisher. A two-time All-American at Texas, Gray was a four-time Pro Bowl pick during his nine NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Rams, Texans Oilers and Buccaneers. He started his coaching career with the then-Titans Oilers in 1997 as defensive quality control assistant when Mike Munchak was promoted to offensive line coach. Gray was promoted to secondary coach in 1999 and 2000. Samari Rolle and Blaine Bishop earned Pro Bowl honors in 2000 when the Titans ranked first in the NFL in fewest yards passing and total yards allowed. He left in 2001 with Gregg Williams for Bills as defensive coordinator through 2005. His defenses in 2003 and 2004 ranked second in the NFL in each season for yards allowed. Both defenses ranked in the top 10 in points allowed. In 2004, the Bills led the NFL with 39 takeaways and were fifth in red zone defense. He coached the secondary in Redskins between 2006 and 2009 before moving to Seahawks for the 2010 season. Gray played with Mike Munchak during the 1992 season for the then-Texans Oilers. \"I have known Mike for a number of years and if he is a head coach like he was a player or a position coach, we are going to be in great shape, because he has had so much success and everything he does,\" Gray said. This is Mike Munchak's second hiring since taking over on Monday. He also hired close friend and fellow Hall of Fame lineman Bruce Matthews to replace him as the offensive line coach. Mike Munchak still has several openings left to fill including offensive coordinator, running backs assistant, defensive line and a couple of other assistants.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6116650", "Entities": ["Titans", "Mike Munchak", "Jeff Fisher", "Rams", "Texans", "Buccaneers", "Bills", "Redskins", "Seahawks"]}, {"title": "Did fraud aid the New York Mets?", "author": "Lester Munson", "date": "Feb 11, 2011", "content": "Fictitious profits. Triple damages. Libel. Sure signs of spring! Won't be long now. Pitchers and catchers report next week, and that includes the pitchers and catchers who work for the New York Mets. In the view from our Courtside Seat, that should make for a particularly interesting Grapefruit League season. Why? Well, read on, because today we start with The magnitude of Fred Wilpon's entanglement with Bernie Madoff defies measurement. But here are some metrics that might help. In the mammoth lawsuit filed by Madoff trustee Irving H. Picard on Dec. 7, 2010, and unsealed on Feb. 4, the description of the relationships between the Ponzi scheme known as Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities and Wilpon's baffling maze of companies, partnerships, trusts, and subsidiaries consumes 377 pages, with another 423 pages of appendixes and exhibits. That's a total of 800 pages of dense legal prose. The Mets alone had 16 accounts with Madoff; and, according to trustee Irving H. Picard, the Mets withdrew at least $90 million in \"fictitious profits\" from these accounts and used \"other people's money\" to \"help fund their day-to-day operations.\" In addition to the team accounts, Wilpon and his various entities and partners opened no fewer than 483 accounts with Madoff. Eleven different Wilpons are specifically named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with another 88 Wilpon-related entities. Included among the total of 99 defendants are six partnerships and corporations that use the word \"Mets\" in their names, including such entities as Mets One LLC and Mets Partners Inc. Picard and his lead attorney, David Sheehan of Baker & Hostetler, accuse Wilpon, his family and his partners of at least four kinds of fraud, asserting that \"with every withdrawal from their [Madoff] accounts they reaped the benefits of a fraud.\" The detail and the specificity of the allegations against the Wilpons and the Mets are impressive, reflecting deep analysis of the Wilpon empire. As Picard and Sheehan describe them in the lawsuit, the Wilpon accounting statements and balance sheets became instruments of deceit. The Wilpons insist that they are victims of Madoff's fraud, but there is no doubt that they have some explaining to do. Will their explanations be believed and accepted? Can they preserve their control over the Mets in the face of Picard's claim that their ownership leverage is based on fictitious Madoff profits and \"other people's money\"? Will the Wilpon empire, when it's all over, join the ranks of Enron and AIG and other massive business frauds? The lawsuit against the Wilpons is only the opening salvo in what will be a long battle. With an enormous load of debt on their myriad enterprises and the downturn in the real estate market, the Wilpons and the word \"insolvency\" can now be used in the same sentence. Their ownership of the Mets is in jeopardy. The family is searching for an investor who, in return for ownership of 25 percent of the team, will help it out from under the threat of a potentially enormous loss in the Madoff litigation. Will the ownership instability affect the team? As the pitchers and catchers report on Thursday of next week, Mets fans will be watching what happens both in Port St. Lucie, Fla., and in the U.S. Courthouse downtown in New York City as former Gov. Mario Cuomo attempts to mediate a settlement between Picard and the Wilpons. A trading card set offers pictures of Oscar Robertson, the only player ever to average a triple-double for an entire NBA season (30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists per game in 1961-62). The photo shows Robertson flying to the rim in his playing days at the University of Bengals. Another merchandising scheme features tiny pieces of one of Robertson's college uniforms. A clip of former Connecticut star Tate George's 15-foot jumper at the buzzer to beat Clemson in a Sweet 16 game in 1990 (ranked by ESPN as one of the top five college basketball shots of all time) has been featured in an ad for McDonald's Egg McMuffin and in ads for vitaminwater, Burger King, Buick, Chrysler and Cadillac. What do Robertson and George receive for the use of their images? Nothing. What are they doing about it? Both have joined a class action lawsuit against the NCAA and IMG's Collegiate Licensing Co. (CLC), demanding payment for what they say is the unauthorized and profitable use of their identities, their exploits and their images. Robertson and George are the latest additions to an impressive array of college basketball and football stars who seek to force the NCAA and CLC, its for-profit partner, to pay them for decades of use of their likenesses. It's an antitrust case, so,if the players and their attorneys are successful, their reimbursement for use of their names would be tripled. In that event, using testimony from expert witnesses to describe the market for iconic sports images, the jury that decides the case would determine how much Robertson and the others should have been paid. If, for example, the NCAA and IMG should have paid Robertson $50,000 per year for 10 years of trading cards, the award to Robertson would be $1.5 million (10 x $50,000 x 3). The award potentially could include dozens if not hundreds of college basketball and football stars whose likenesses have been used over the years. \"What troubles me the most is the arrogance of the NCAA when it says it has the right to do this,\" Robertson said two weeks ago in an interview with Yahoo! Sports. \"The University of Bengals gets a fee each time my picture is used on a card. I don't. When I played there, there was nothing like this ever agreed to.\" The case could easily become a major humiliation for the NCAA and IMG -- and a major financial loss, as well. On its website, CLC asserts that there is a \"$4 billion annual market for collegiate licensed merchandise.\" And that doesn't include ads, videos, trading cards and other profitable exploitations of the players. The players' biggest problem in the litigation is a form the NCAA requires its \"student-athletes\" to sign before they play in their first game. Known as Form 08-3a, it requires the players to surrender all rights to their images. The NCAA contends that the players give up their rights \"in perpetuity,\" but Stanley Chesley, the highly regarded antitrust lawyer who represents the players, claims the form is \"purposefully misleading, incomplete and ambiguous on its face.\" In court papers, he has added that the NCAA schools force their athletes to sign it \"under duress\" and \"without informed consent.\" The NCAA's biggest problem in the litigation is the admission by its then-president, Myles Brand, in a September 2008 letter that \"the right of publicity is held by the student-athletes, not by the NCAA.\" In addition to the damaging statement by Brand, who died a year later, the NCAA could have to confront some other thick language its own officers have offered on the record. In a \"State of the Association\" speech in 2009, NCAA vice president Wallace Renfro, attempting to explain the issue, stated, \"There are several orthogonal parameters that must be understood in order to find the balance point in commercial activity.\" In a further attempt at explanation, Renfro added, \"Exploiting student-athletes for commercial purposes is as contrary to the collegiate model as paying them.\" Does that mean that the NCAA will return the profits it receives from its sale of the images of Robertson and the others? That's as likely as the NCAA deciding to pay its athletes. Robertson, the master of the triple-double, is leading an effort that could produce triple damages in amounts that certainly would get the full attention of the NCAA and IMG. For the nearly three months since the Redskins City Paper published an encyclopedic and critical history of his ownership of the Redskins, Dan Snyder's life has been one of \"shame, mortification, hurt feelings, embarrassment, and humiliation.\" It has been so difficult for Snyder that he was forced to file a libel suit against the weekly paper, claiming money damages of at least $2 million for the pain and suffering inside those quotes. In his catalog of Snyder's \"hilarious and/or heinous deeds,\" the City Paper's Dave McKenna barely mentions the embarrassing contracts Snyder made with Jeff George, Bruce Smith, Deion Sanders and Albert Haynesworth. The writer was more interested in Snyder selling peanuts from a bankrupt airline long after the peanuts' shelf-life had expired, in Snyder litigating a pay dispute with a former nanny, and in Snyder viewing cancer and diabetes patients as \"market segments\" for one of his many businesses. It's those personal and business criticisms that anger Snyder and, he says, forced him to file suit even though he \"accepts the right of the public and the press to criticize him or to express personal dislike, whether or not such expressions are justified by the facts.\" Snyder is particularly annoyed with McKenna's assertions that Snyder was \"caught forging names as a telemarketer,\" used \"Agent Orange to destroy trees\" that interfered with the view of the Potomac River from his home and was \"thrown off the Six Flags board of directors\" after a bumpy few years. McKenna, according to Snyder, has devoted \"50 columns\" to his criticisms of Snyder over the years, and Snyder is clearly tired of it. To pursue his claim against the weekly paper, Snyder has hired Patricia Glaser of Los Angeles, one of America's top trial lawyers. In an odd way, the filing of the lawsuit has multiplied the impact of the City Paper's look at Snyder, as news organizations across the nation have described a column they had previously ignored. Although Snyder promises to give anything he collects in the lawsuit to the homeless, it seems clear from a letter his staff lawyer sent to the City Paper that he's more interested in intimidating or even destroying the paper. In the letter, first reported by David Carr in The New York Times, the Redskins' general counsel, David P. Donovan, explains, \"Mr. Snyder has more than sufficient means to protect his reputation and [to] defend himself and his wife against your paper's concerted attempt at character assassination. The cost of litigation would presumably quickly outstrip the asset value of the [paper].\" The paper has responded by hiring Floyd Abrams, one of the top First Amendment and libel lawyers anywhere. The litigation will take its course in the next year or so, but here's the more important issue: What will the City Paper do in its next story on Snyder? The guess here is that the Redskins' owner might soon be suffering from even more \"shame, mortification, hurt feelings, embarrassment, and humiliation.\" Lester Munson, a Bears lawyer and journalist who reports on investigative and legal issues in the sports industry, is a senior writer for ESPN.com.

So have the players. What about the agents? Some say they aren't expecting much progress in negotiations between the NFL and the players' union before the collective bargaining agreement expires March 3. \"The reason for that date is it's the end of the league year,\" said Joe Linta, who represents Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco and three dozen other players. \"Sure, an extension could be coming. If I still believe in Santa Claus, I still have hope.\" Linta is among many agents who believe every other issue will get resolved quickly enough once the owners and union agree on how to split nearly $9 billion in revenues. The owners get $1 billion off the top for operating expenses and are seeking an additional $1 billion. The players note how popular the league is, with record TV ratings, and say they shouldn't have to take a pay cut. \"It's all about money, as it always is,\" he said Friday, \"and everything will flow from there once there's a macro agreement.\" Ralph Cindrich has been through every labor dispute between players and owners dating back to the 1970s and the union's infancy. While saying of the state of negotiations \"it's fair to call it a mess,\" Cindrich also concludes \"it's too early to panic\" and when both parties want to seriously negotiate, they will. \"When they come to the time period when decisions need to be made, that's when they will get down to something,\" said Cindrich, who represents Steelers linebacker James Farrior and Colts center Jeff Saturday, among many others. A key issue is the owners' intent to include a rookie wage scale, which Linta calls \"way overblown\" and Peter Schaffer, agent for All-Pro tackle Joe Thomas, says is \"scouting insurance against poor selection decisions.\" The rookie wage scale proposed by the owners would cover a five-year period. Many players and their representatives say that translates into a veteran wage scale, too, by limiting earnings for players whose average career is less than five years. Besides, Schaffer says in an e-mail to The Associated Press, a rookie wage scale would not really help NFL owners' spending concerns, and it would damage college football by causing a rush of underclassmen turning pro earlier so they could get to free agency quicker. \"The reality is that the current NFL draft system in its entirety is a tremendous economic windfall to the NFL teams,\" Schaffer said, \"as it provides a large source of cheap, young labor to the league signed for contracts exceeding four years.\" That's not true for the highest picks in the draft -- Rams quarterback Sam Bradford signed a deal with $50 million guaranteed as the top selection last year. But, as Linta mentions, the extremely lucrative contracts go to a dozen or fewer rookies. Devin McCourty, selected 27th overall last April, received $10 million over five years, which Schaffer said was not in the top 60 for cornerbacks. Devin McCourty started for Patriots and made the Pro Bowl. Eugene Parker, who has Ndamukong Suh, the Defensive Rookie of the Year, among his clients, sees a rookie wage scale as an incentive for agents to potentially not represent players coming out of college. \"It could be a scenario like basketball where the salaries are fixed and there really is little negotiating room for the agent up front,\" Parker told Sirius NFL Radio on Friday, \"and if that is the case you will see more and more agents focusing on the vet players than on the rookie players.\" Expanding the regular season to 18 games is negotiable in the view of the dozen agents interviewed by the AP. Each of them cited player safety and the increased chance for injuries as the major stumbling block to a longer regular season. Don Yee, who represents league MVP Tom Brady, suggested a longer season be accompanied by increased roster size from 53 players to 58, all eligible to play on game day; currently, only 45 can suit up, plus a third quarterback. He also would institute a rule that prohibits any player from appearing in more than 16 games. \"This compromise will create even more interest from fans,\" Yee said. \"What two games will the head coach sit the starting QB? That's a discussion that will set sports talk radio airwaves afire. \"This compromise will also be popular with coaches and general managers who want a greater opportunity to develop younger players. The NFL doesn't have a minor league, and this compromise will force meaningful participation by younger players on the roster. \"Players also would endorse this because each would effectively get two bye weeks during the year. Bye weeks afford important healing time and personal time away from the game.\" The agents get their information on negotiations from the NFLPA and its player representatives. They say the lines of communication have been good thus far. \"Technically, he has no obligation to us,\" Linta says of union head DeMaurice Smith. \"We are piano players, nobodies in the process. But he is keeping us informed and making it timely.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6113860", "Entities": ["Ravens", "Joe Flacco", "Steelers", "James Farrior", "Colts", "Jeff Saturday", "Joe Thomas", "Rams", "Sam Bradford", "Devin McCourty", "Patriots", "Ndamukong Suh", "Tom Brady"]}, {"title": "NFL will miss L.A. leverage", "author": "Mark Kreidler", "date": "Feb 14, 2011", "content": "Sooner or later, somebody will win the pro football stadium race in Los Angeles. It's practically a mathematical certainty. The sheer volume of attempts, failures, false starts, news conferences, empty rhetorical detours and, above all, exploitable marketing opportunities suggests that it'll happen, be it on the 100th try or the 1,000th. And when that day arrives, I believe with all my heart that some in the NFL will weep and gnash teeth. It will mark the conclusion of what has been, for them, a very good time indeed. Call it the end of the sun-drenched threat. The current and competing leaders in the clubhouse, billionaire Philip Anschutz's AEG (downtown by the Staples Center) and developer Ed Roski (the Industry area outside of the city), both have a chance at getting the thing done, although by this point any attentive Angeleno would place no such bets. Lots of noise does not necessarily -- or even often -- equal action. Still, AEG's announcement that it had secured a $700 million naming-rights deal from Farmers Insurance would appear to move things down the track just a bit. And it lends some weight to the idea that L.A. will relatively soon house actual pro football teams rather than the memory of them. When teams come in, the hammer goes out. This won't mark the demise of threats in general in the NFL, of course. That will never happen. Some cities have done their best work over the years with a figurative gun to their heads, and it wasn't always the franchise-free L.A. area that was the designated heavy. But to understand just how valuable Los Angeles has been to Tha League as an open market, you have to be willing to survey the imposing number of implied or overt threats that involved L.A. as a likely destination these past 16 years. (That is, ever since the Rams and Raiders high-tailed it to their current states of dissatisfaction, Rams and Raiders, respectively.) Vikings? Check and double-check. Chargers? Don't get me started. Jaguars and Bills, one supposes, are almost always feeling a Pacific breeze (although you'd have to pry the Bills out of the frozen hands of their ardent fans). The Rams are lately said to be potential candidates for a moving party, which has to strike somebody somewhere as the sort of turnabout an L.A. fan could at least appreciate. And way back in 2004, it was good old Colts that was put through the wringer, as Colts bigwig Jim Irsay publicly fretted over the city's corporate base and wondered whether even a new stadium -- shiny, preferably, and with lots and lots of bells and whistles -- would be enough to make it work in the American heartland. Said Irsay, \"How much can you keep putting your own money into your franchise with no hope of seeing things change?\" Irsay spoke, at the time, as a man with ties to the L.A. entertainment industry and a membership at the Riviera Country Club. Four years later, the Colts were moving into brand-new Lucas Oil Stadium in Indy. Did they ever seriously ponder relocation? It doesn't matter in the slightest. This is the value of having a huge open market like Los Angeles in the mix. Other NFL cities can feel their throats getting chalky every time a stadium situation starts to go south, because in the backs of their minds they can also see things going west. Paul Tagliabue, the former commissioner, never seemed in a terrible hurry to fill the L.A. market. His successor, Roger Goodell, has other things on his plate at the moment, so you can excuse him for not moving the L.A. issue to the top of the heap. Without a collective bargaining agreement, rating the prospects for a new stadium in a city that doesn't even have a team seems faintly ludicrous (and then, as you get closer, totally ludicrous). But when Goodell says, as he did during his Super Bowl week news conference, that \"We need to find a solution to the stadium issue in Chargers,\" everyone understands the context within which such a comment is offered. Here's the context: The Spanos family, which owns the Chargers franchise, has options. And it will continue to have such options for as long as L.A. goes unoccupied. On balance, it'd seem to be a better idea to have the NFL in Los Angeles than not to have it. For that reason, most of the people who follow this sort of thing for a living believe that a plan will emerge, be it AEG's or Roski's or someone else's. Once a stadium becomes a reality, the popular thinking is that Goodell and the owners would approve the move of two franchises back into the L.A. basin, one from each conference. For example: the Chargers and the Vikings. Or maybe the Jags and the Rams. You get the idea. The NFL has spent the past 16 years making sure you do.

Earlier, he tweeted about his mother and grandmother, who have been incarcerated on drug charges since he was 12: \"Only if i had my mother and granny here with me, stuff would be so different.\" Demaryius Thomas had a tough year after leaving Georgia Tech following his junior season. He fractured his left foot in pre-draft workouts but was still the first receiver selected in the draft when the Broncos chose him at number 22, three spots ahead of their other first-round pick, quarterback Tim Tebow. Demaryius Thomas was just starting to flash his athleticism and mobility, using his 6-foot-3, 230-pound frame to outjump defenders when he re-injured his surgically repaired foot early in training camp and didn't return until after the opener. He had a spectacular debut in Week 2, catching eight passes for 97 yards and a touchdown against Seahawks, but he never tallied more than three catches in any game the rest of the season. He was knocked out of one game with a concussion while returning a kickoff and was also sidelined for the final five weeks of the season with a sprained ankle. Demaryius Thomas played in 10 games, starting twice and finishing with 22 receptions for 283 yards and two scores. He also returned 16 kicks for a 24.9-yard average. He showed enough promise, as did fellow rookie Eric Decker, for new coach John Fox to proclaim upon his hiring that the wide receiver corps led by Pro Bowler Brandon Lloyd and Jabar Gaffney was the area that needed the least attention during the team's massive makeover. That's changed. First, slot receiver Eddie Royal underwent a hip operation that will keep him out at least until late May, and now Demaryius Thomas will be sidelined at least through August and maybe much longer.

That offer of a 50-50 split of all revenues wasn't going to bring immediate harmony, but it showed what I thought all along -- that the players want to get a deal done. In a Saturday meeting during Super Bowl week, both sides set aside two days a week through the end of the month to move the process. Although subcommittees from both sides have kept talking, the owners haven't changed their stance. In a business that grosses between $9 billion and $10 billion per year, the owners insist on receiving another $1 billion credit (they already receive $1 billion under the current CBA) for stadium financing and operating costs. Even though they're not ready to make a deal, the owners need to make a counter that addresses their needs and acknowledges the movement of the players. No counter would show what players have feared for a long time -- that owners want to use a lockout to win the talks. For everyone's sake, let's hope that's not the case. Q: I have seen a lot of people saying the Vikings should take Cam Newton with the 12th pick, which is too high in my mind. The team has a lot of needs and not many picks this year. What are your thoughts? Matt in Melrose, Minn. A: I get the feeling the Vikings will lean toward getting a veteran quarterback, although Cam Newton has to be intriguing. I'm sure he reminds the Vikings' brass of their days with Daunte Culpepper. But this also is a veteran team with a short window to win. With this being the last year of the Metrodome lease, the team will lean toward winning now instead of getting a quarterback for later. Offensive line and cornerback are two of the bigger needs, along with safety. Q: I believe the Falcons need a speed receiver to complement WR Roddy White and a pass-catching speed back to complement RB Michael Turner. I also think they need to draft a tight end who can replace the aging Tony Gonzalez. Thus, I think the Falcons will have an offense-heavy draft similar to the defense-heavy draft they had in 2009. Your thoughts? Junior in Falcons A: Don't forget the defense. The Falcons need a young pass-rusher to take over for John Abraham. A speed receiver would be a luxury. What the Falcons need more than anything else is better production from the slot receiver. I thought Harry Douglas was going to have a breakthrough season, but he didn't. Jerious Norwood was supposed to be the speed back, but he's been hurt too much the past two years to count on. I'm with you on the speed back, but don't forget the defense. Q: With the recent Hall of Fame class settled, I wanted to ask why the classes are so limited? Why limit how many can get in? I wouldn't want to see a diluted Hall of Fame, but perhaps open it to a few more spots. A backlog of candidates means that every year the memory of their time playing/coaching fades. This is not a current question, just one I think about every year when people complain about so and so being snubbed. Joe in London A: The Pro Football Hall of Fame handles the number of candidates. Voters don't have a say. The maximum is currently five modern-day candidates and two senior candidates in a year. It has been suggested that there should be a clean-up year to let some of the deserving candidates get in, but the Hall believes it would be too much. The Hall thinks going over seven in one class could be overkill. The night of speeches would be too long. What the Hall doesn't want to do is diminish how precious it is to be enshrined. In most years, we believe there are 14 or 15 legitimate Hall of Famers in the final 15. It just takes time to get them in. Q: I want to bring up an issue that maybe you can explain for me involving the NFL draft. The NFL uses regular-season record to determine draft order. The Saints were a number 5 seed, went on the road in Round 1 of the playoffs and have to pick after number 3/4 seeds Colts, Philly and K.C., who all had home playoff games. The way it is set up actually makes teams that at the end of the regular season have clinched certain seeds want to lose just so their draft order can improve. Shouldn't the draft order for playoff teams be determined differently, perhaps by their seeds, not their regular-season records? Hoss in Shepherdstown, W.Va. A: After the Chargers made the playoffs with an 8-8 record and got a pretty high spot in the draft order, the NFL changed the rules. It broke off all the teams that didn't make the playoffs. It gave teams with the worst records the higher spots and broke ties by giving the teams with the easier schedules the higher spots. The seeds of teams in the playoffs don't matter. The Saints are slotted by record and schedule, among the playoff teams. I don't see anything unfair about their spot in the draft. Q: Your QB rankings are stuck in 2008. How can you not put Aaron Rodgers number 1? I understand that he doesn't have the complete body of work like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Drew Brees. But it's all about today and tomorrow, and honestly, who would your rather have next year and for the foreseeable future? Give me Aaron Rodgers for the next six years at least. He's got a young, talented supporting cast, and Aaron Rodgers is only going to get better, as opposed to the others who are winding down their respective careers Jesse in Colts A: Aaron Rodgers isn't a one-year wonder, but Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Drew Brees have been putting together great years for a longer period of time. Let him do this for several years and then re-evaluate. If you were a Drew Brees fan, you would have been outraged last year if he weren't ranked ahead of Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. Don't forget, Tom Brady was the unanimous choice for MVP this season. He certainly wasn't stuck in 2008. Q: There seem to be a lot of negative reports about Cowboys Stadium post-Super Bowl. But there's one issue not being addressed that I think should: the field. With players slipping and sliding the whole game, you'd think it was made of ice. With a recent survey of the players' union that showed almost 90 percent of players believe artificial turf causes more soreness and fatigue and is more likely to shorten careers, isn't it time to re-examine artificial fields and possibly find a better solution? Mark in Greensboro, N.C. A: Actually, the Cowboys Stadium field was judged to be reasonably good by the players. Safety is a big part of the NFL nowadays and fields will be examined on a regular basis. The players seem to accept field turf. If you looked at the survey, players weren't happy with some of the grass fields in Steelers, Bears, Raiders and other places. The players also voted that artificial turf is preferable in cold-weather cities, particularly those that have college and high school teams using the stadium.

Should you still, as the old wisdom of fantasy in the 1990s would have it, always draft a running back in the first round? Or do these days of committee backs and anxiety over high carry totals compel you to cast your lot early with the NFL's more explosive passing games? As I seem to write constantly leading up to fantasy drafts every year: there is no \"correct\" way to look at positions, only players. If you could've looked into the future last August and understood what was about to happen during the season, you'd have answered the \"Should I draft Adrian Peterson or Chris Johnson first overall?\" debate with a simple answer: Draft Arian Foster. If you could redo the debate which had you flummoxed deciding between Rashard Mendenhall and Randy Moss at the tail end of your 2010 draft's first round, well, I think we know by now that debate was less about which position to draft, and more about which player was going to get traded twice because his skills no longer make up for his attitude. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be learned by taking a look at the positional trends of 2010. That's where Value-Based Drafting comes in. For frame of reference, here's a piece from last summer in which I broke down VBD in depth. The upshot is that VBD is a way to compare the relative values of quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends and defenses, so that we can get a sense of whether there's an advantage in drafting one position early above all others. After all, in absolute terms, you might look at 2010's fantasy point totals and conclude pretty clearly that quarterbacks are the most valuable players in fantasy: Thinking in purely absolute terms, you'd be tempted to say, \" Forget about drafting running backs in the first round! Obviously, it makes more sense to get a quarterback! They're a source of high, safe points each and every year!\" But of course, even the quasi-savvy fantasy player knows that's unwise: Precisely because QBs are by their natures a consistent source of points, and because RBs and WRs fluctuate far more wildly, you can easily make an argument that in relative terms, it makes a good deal of sense to wait on a QB, because the one you wind up with might not be Aaron Rodgers, but should still be just fine. Value-Based Drafting is one way to quantify positional scarcity to get a sense of which positions were more valuable in the'10 season. Conceptually, the idea is to compare the top point-earners at each position to some \"baseline\" player at the same position. If we can get a sense of how much better the superstar QBs are than the baseline QB, and compare it to how much better the superstar RBs are than the baseline RB, we can start to be able to compare positions. My preferred method of establishing baseline players comes from Footballguys.com: In a 10-team league, I look at how many QBs go in the first 10 rounds, and that number represents the rank of my baseline QB. I look at how many RBs go in the first 10 rounds, and that's my baseline RB, etc. The logic is that most players who'll be fantasy starters get drafted in the first 10 rounds of the average draft, and therefore the last such player at each position represents the final guy you'd take to fill the spot you didn't use if you eschewed, for example, an elite quarterback in the first or second round. It's a simplified \"value over replacement player\" that puts us in the neighborhood of how difficult it would be to replace a given player at a given position. Historical statistics teach us that in a 10-team draft, on average, 16 quarterbacks tend to go in the first 100 picks (each team drafts a starter, about half the teams draft a backup), 38 running backs tend to go in the top 100, as well as 33 wide receivers, nine tight ends and four defenses. That means for the 2010 season, the following men qualify as our \"baseline\" players: Now, there's no question there are mitigating factors with these particular players, one that a purely statistical evaluation method is going to miss. Orton was on pace for a much better season before getting yanked in favor of Tim Tebow for three games. Floyd might've been higher on his positional list without his injury troubles. Nevertheless, if we could go back and redo a 10-team fantasy draft and fill each team in accordance with the positional numbers I listed above (i.e., 16 QBs, 38 RBs, 33 WRs, 9 TEs, 4 D/ST get drafted), these five players would roughly represent the final few picks of the 10th round. They are our baseline players. Now our task is to compare each of these guys to the players who finished ahead of them at their respective positions. The goal? Establish how much better than Orton, for example, Michael Vick was. Sure, his season was spectacular. But was it so spectacular that it was worth picking Michael Vick ahead of the elite running backs? After all, if the baseline QB got you 200 fantasy points, were Michael Vick's 300 fantasy points as valuable as they look? Without further ado, here are the top 100 fantasy players in 2010, according to VBD: Wow. Let's just say that running backs made something of a comeback, eh? Instead of seeing one RB and nine QBs in the top 10, as we did when we looked at absolute fantasy point totals only, now we see the first 12 spots held by rushers, with Mr. Michael Vick clocking in at number 13, in a tie with the first wideout off the board, Brandon Lloyd. And the clear dominant force in fantasy, at least from a VBD perspective, was not Michael Vick, but rather Arian Foster. His 81-point gap over second-place Adrian Peterson (and his 228-point gap over \"baseline\" running back Ricky Williams) made him fantasy's clear MVP for 2010. By way of comparison, this is what the top 10 VBD performers from 2009 looked like: So you wouldn't instantly put Arian Foster's'10 season in a league entirely of its own; in fact, he and Chris Johnson circa'09 were basically equally dominant. But as you can see, this year's best running backs were even more top-heavy than last year's, while this year's quarterbacks and wideouts had fewer top-end standouts. Does this automatically mean you should take a running back in the first round of your 2011 fantasy draft (assuming, of course, that an NFL season will actually be played this fall)? Of course not. As I always write, players are what wins fantasy leagues, not positions. Draft the best players, and you'll be fine. But I do think these VBD numbers are sobering for those who'll hurry to say, \"Because there are so many committee backs, you should shy away from taking rushers early.\" If you draft the correct running backs, you'll be operating from an advantage that few (if any) quarterbacks or receivers can supply. Of course, there are several things that a system as (let's face it) mathematically simple-minded as VBD can't account for, which is why we should take none of these lists as utter gospel: \u2022 Week-to-week variability. It's all well and good that Darren McFadden is sixth on our VBD list. I mean, no question, he had a breakout season. But his week-to-week variability was a killer. Compare his weekly lines to the three men directly below him, LeSean McCoy, Michael Turner and Rashard Mendenhall, and you'll see one of these things is not like the other. Forget the games he sat due to injury; even when he played, Run-DMC had a weekly standard deviation of nearly 12 fantasy points. By contrast, LeSean McCoy (6.9), Michael Turner (8.6) and Rashard Mendenhall (6.0) achieved their equally high point totals without big ups and downs. Yes, it was nice to own Darren McFadden in Weeks 7 and 14, when he scored 43 and 38 fantasy points, respectively, but not as nice to own him from Weeks 9 through 12, when he managed a total of just 16 fantasy points. And all this is to say nothing of players like Austin Collie or Jahvid Best, who show up on our list despite crushing their fantasy teams with season-altering injuries in midstream, or a guy like Michael Vick, who missed most of four midseason games, yet still was huge for fantasy teams come playoff time. \u2022 Unlikely studs. It's all well and good to proclaim running backs the way to go in the early rounds of your fantasy draft, but how many of you would've put Arian Foster in the elite category before the season began, especially after the Texans drafted Ben Tate last April? Or to take more extreme examples, how about Brandon Lloyd and BenJarvus Green-Ellis? Heck, by the letter of the law, Ray Rice had a better fantasy season than BJGE. But you won't find many Ray Rice owners crowing about it. His expectations were much higher than finishing 10th among fantasy rushers, while BenJarvus Green-Ellis came from nowhere to dominate goal-line touches in Patriots. Automatically proclaiming you have a bias toward taking a rusher in the first round doesn't mean you'll pick the right rusher. (For this reason, one of my offseason projects is to try to develop a VBD \"Reliability Index,\" to get a sense of the likelihood that a player tends to wind up in an acceptable VBD range on a season-to-season basis.) \u2022 Late bloomers. Someone like LeGarrette Blount suffers on a season-long VBD survey because he wasn't really given an opportunity to play until Week 7. From that point on, he was a monster, but his VBD rank still puts him tied with Thomas Jones for 49th overall (24th among rushers). Of course, anyone in contention down the stretch this November and December knows which of those running backs you'd rather have had toiling for your team. You could put players like Chris Ivory and Ryan Torain in that same category. Bottom line, are these VBD results predictive of what will happen next year? On a player-by-player basis, in large part, no, and it's obvious why: at bottom, they're simply based on the previous year's statistics, and the NFL is a year-to-year league. When players like Ricky Williams, Brett Favre and Joseph Addai grade out very well in 2009's VBD, it's because they performed well in fantasy, because they performed well in real life. As soon as they started to stink it up for your fantasy team? Naturally their personal VBD numbers stunk, too. The most useful thing VBD does is allow us to look among positions, and figure out, for example, where a \"spectacular\" fantasy quarterback season (like Michael Vick's) should rate among the best of other positions. And for me, the bottom line continues to be: no matter how amazing you expect a given signal-caller or receiver to be next season, he's not going to be worth as much as a running back you feel relatively comfortable will be a top-10 guy.

When the NFL and the NFL Players Association are involved. According to sources familiar with the talks, last week's negotiations between the NFLPA and the NFL broke off when the union characterized its documents as an \"illustration\" that NFL officials believed represented a proposal for revenue sharing between owners and players. When the NFLPA characterized documents labeled \"NFLPA Proposal\" as something other than a collective bargaining proposal, the NFL ended the session, a source familiar with the talks said. League representatives then met outside the room, and returned only to abort the negotiations -- without immediately rescheduling any talks, the source added. \"As often happens in collective bargaining, the parties reached a point where there was a fundamental difference on a critical issue that was not going to be reconciled that day,\" said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. \"The discussions were adjourned to permit both parties to assess their positions and consider how to move the process forward. Far from abandoning the process, in the first four days after the Super Bowl, we have had two meetings of our labor executive committee and negotiating team, a conference call with all 32 clubs, and a meeting with the union.\" The day after negotiations broke down, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell convened a conference call with the owners of the 32 NFL teams and reported the developments of the previous day. A person familiar with that call said there was complete unanimity among the owners. Despite the aborted Wednesday session, dialogue has continued between the two sides through smaller working groups as well as communication between Goodell and NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith. While a meeting this week had been expected to occur between the two sides, an NFLPA source said Monday the meeting is now in doubt as the league has not called to confirm the two days of negotiating sessions that had been scheduled. But there is a growing discord and mistrust between the two sides. Management was irritated by Smith's decision to release the owners' counterproposal on a rookie wage scale to players and player agents, as opposed to offering a response directly to management. Even the choice of descriptive words was a source of irritation. Whereas Smith noted that renegotiations or extensions of rookie contracts were \"banned\" until after the third year, a management official said the proposal \"allows\" for those renegotiations or extensions after the third year. Regardless, the intent and meaning are the same. One person connected to the NFLPA said NFL owners were continuing to be \"unreasonable,\" which accounted for the disintegration of last week's meeting. Now, knowledgeable sources who previously were optimistic that CBA negotiations would not result in any lost games next season are growing increasingly pessimistic. One source said last week's flare-up was symbolic and illuminated the schism between the two sides. Now there is a general feeling that some or all of the 2011 season may be at risk, though there is plenty of time for the two sides to continue talking and trying to bridge their vast differences.

ESPN Insider draft experts Mel Kiper and Todd McShay don't often agree, but their first mock drafts of the year concurred on one topic: The Cowboys should draft Nebraska cornerback Prince Amukamara with the ninth overall pick. With Mike Jenkins a year removed from the Pro Bowl, it's very clear who Prince Amukamara would replace in the lineup: veteran corner Newman, who was the most expensive starter in a pass defense that ranked 28th in DVOA last season. Newman's numbers in 2010 weren't pretty. Among the 68 defensive backs with 50 targets or more, he was 63rd in yards per attempt (9.1) and 61st in Success Rate (43 percent). There is one complicating factor, though. Newman played through most of the season with an extremely debilitating rib injury, suffered during the same Week 7 loss to the Giants that produced Tony Romo's broken collarbone. Before he suffered the injury, Newman averaged 7.1 yards per attempt and had a 58 percent Success Rate on 26 targets; afterward, he was a different player, allowing 10.0 yards per attempt with a 37 percent Success Rate.

He was 79. Bob Cook had been to 44 straight Super Bowls but couldn't make it to Texas to watch his beloved Packers defeat the Steelers on Feb. 6. Instead, Cook viewed the game from his hospital bed with his wife, who decorated his room with green and gold lights. Cook, whose obituary ends with \"GO PACK GO,\" died last week after a blood infection and other chronic issues, including congestive heart failure, his wife, Sarah Cook, said Monday. She said they had their bags packed and were ready to go, but Bob Cook told his wife three days before the game that he was too ill to travel to the game. \"I'm just a die-hard Packer fan,\" he told The Associated Press before the Packers' win over the Bears in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 23. \"I'd rather watch football than any other sport.\" The Brown Deer, Wis., man and the three other members of the \"Never Missed a Super Bowl\" club -- Thomas Henschel, of Tampa, Fla., Larry Jacobson, of 49ers and Don Crisman, Kennebunk, Maine -- were the stars of the Visa ad leading up to the Super Bowl. Tom Henschel, 69, said Cook was the last to join the group, during the 36th Super Bowl. Henschel had met Crisman and another man who also had been to every Super Bowl around the 17th Super Bowl. Henschel, a Steelers fan, said Cook's two daughters went to the game in his place. \"It was kind of strange,\" he said. \"Here's his team playing against my team. I thought we'd have a little fun. Maybe put a little wager on the game.\" Cook was the former owner of Bob Cook's Vagabond Travel Service and started going to Super Bowls while working there. When asked in January why he goes to every Super Bowl he said: \"I don't like the season to end.\" \"When football's over I wait for the preseason,\" he said. \"No, I wait for the draft. Then the preseason. Then the season. Then the post-season. I worked hard not to let it end.\" Cook said it was relatively easy to get tickets for the first few Super Bowls. He said he even had to go to a few Super Bowl cities without tickets but always got lucky when he got there. One year someone gave him tickets for free but another he had to sell off some of his jazz record collection to get a ticket.

The league's filing says the union \"consistently has failed to confer in good faith\" during negotiations for a new contract and the union's \"conduct amounts to surface bargaining and an anticipatory refusal to bargain.\" A statement e-mailed to The Associated Press by union spokesman George Atallah says the NFL's \"claim has absolutely no merit.\" The NLRB is a federal agency that enforces the nation's labor laws and referees labor-management disputes. The current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the day March 3. The NFL Players Association has said it expects the owners to lock out players; the NFL's filing with the NLRB says that the union wants to \"run out the clock\" and, essentially, avoid reaching a new CBA so it can decertify and file an antitrust lawsuit. Players already have voted, team by team, to authorize decertifying their union if a new CBA isn't reached by the deadline. The NFLPA already decertified in 1989, then returned as a union in 1993, when a contract was reached with the league that provided for free agency. That landmark CBA was renewed or restructured several times since 1993, including in 2006. The owners opted out of that most recent deal in 2008. Under the heading \"Basis of the Charge,\" the NFL says in Monday's filing with the NLRB that during current negotiations, the union delayed the scheduling of bargaining sessions; failed to \"respond in a timely and/or meaningful manner\" to owners' contract proposals; and insisted on \"disclosure of financial data to which the NFLPA has no legal right and then suspending negotiations unless and until such data is produced.\" The league's filing also accuses the NFLPA of \"engaging in other actions demonstrating that the union has approached these negotiations with no intent to reach agreement through good faith collective bargaining.\" Atallah's e-mailed statement said: \"The players didn't walk out and the players can't lock out. Players want a fair, new and long-term deal. We have offered proposals and solutions on every issue the owners have raised.\" The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues; under the old deal, the owners receive $1 billion off the top, and they want to increase that to $2 billion before players get their share. Among the other significant points in negotiations: the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; a rookie wage scale; and benefits for retired players. The NFL and union went more than two months without holding any formal bargaining sessions, until a meeting Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once last week but called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. While a meeting this week had been expected to occur between the two sides, an NFLPA source told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen on Monday that the league has not called to confirm the two days of negotiating sessions that had been scheduled. The NFL has not missed games due to labor strife since 1987, when the players went on strike and the owners continued the season with replacement players. Making reference to the 1989 decertification, the NFL's filing says: \"As in the past, the NFLPA's threatened disclaimer as the representative of the players, together with the now-familiar antitrust litigation that is expected to follow, is a ploy and an unlawful subversion of the collective bargaining process, there being no evidence whatsoever of any [let alone widespread] disaffection with the union by its members.\" The NFL also said Monday that it will hold its owners meetings on March 3 -- the final day of the current collective bargaining agreement. All 32 owners are expected to be at the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that follows two days of committee meetings that were previously scheduled.

John Harbaugh took the Ravens to the playoffs in each of his three seasons after replacing Brian Billick in January 2008. Ravens is 32-16 in the regular season under John Harbaugh and 4-3 in the playoffs.

ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter first reported the news. \"Logan Mankins is a tremendous player. He has been a fixture on our offensive line since we drafted him in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft and he remains an important part of our future plans,\" the team said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach a long-term agreement, despite many attempts and proposals by both sides. That remains our objective in utilizing the franchise designation and we are hopeful that Logan will be a Patriot for many years to come.\" Logan Mankins is the first player to be designated a team's franchise player this offseason. The franchise tag essentially binds Logan Mankins to the Patriots for one year. The projected contract for a franchised offensive lineman is $10.1 million, down from $10.7 million last season. That salary would be guaranteed once Logan Mankins signed the tender offer. The Patriots used the non-exclusive tag, according to a source, meaning Logan Mankins can negotiate with other teams and sign an offer sheet. However, that other team would need to forfeit two first-round draft choices to the Patriots, according to the current rules. It is possible that the Patriots would accept less in the form of a trade, assuming they were willing to deal Logan Mankins. At the Pro Bowl last month, Logan Mankins told the Boston Herald that he wouldn't be happy with the franchise tag. His hope is for a long-term contract that would include more guaranteed money up-front. Still, the $10.1 million makes it a less bitter pill for Logan Mankins to swallow, as it is more than he has earned in his first six seasons in the NFL. For the Patriots, the franchise tag protects one of their top assets. \"Logan Mankins is one of the best players on the team,\" owner Robert Kraft said Feb. 4 at the Super Bowl. \"I hope he's with us for a long-term and we're going to try to do whatever we have to do to make sure that happens.\" One factor that clouds the future with Logan Mankins and the franchise tag is the NFL's uncertain labor forecast. Owners believe they can use the franchise tag, while the NFL Players Association believes the tag cannot be used because the collective bargaining agreement doesn't extend into the 2011 season. One of the key considerations with all tagged players is what owners decide when the collective bargaining agreement expires March 4. If owners lock players out, Logan Mankins could pursue the matter legally by arguing that he can't be restricted with the tag when players are locked out. Some with ties to the NFL Players Association believe Logan Mankins would have a strong case in that scenario. If owners don't lock players out, Logan Mankins would remain in limbo until a new collective bargaining agreement is reached. It's possible that teams will eventually be allowed to assign players the franchise tag as part of a new collective bargaining agreement. There is also the possibility that Logan Mankins becomes a free agent if the franchise tag is not part of a new collective bargaining agreement. Logan Mankins, 28, was a first-round draft pick of the Patriots in 2005. He has been to three Pro Bowls, including this year. Logan Mankins and the Patriots were at odds last summer, when Logan Mankins said he hoped to be traded because of the slow pace of negotiations on a contract extension. Logan Mankins was a restricted free agent -- a result of the NFL's going from a salary-cap system to an uncapped year -- but did not sign his $3.26 million tender. That led to an extended standoff, with Logan Mankins not reporting until the eighth game of the season. The Patriots sliced his tender to $1.54 million, which was prorated over the final nine games of the season. In an interview with ESPNBoston.com in June, Logan Mankins explained his stance. \"After the 2008 season, me and my agent approached the Patriots about an extension and I was told that Mr. Kraft did not want to do an extension because of the [uncertain collective bargaining agreement],\" he said at the time. \"I was asked to play'09 out, and that they would address the contract during the uncapped year. I'm a team player, I took them at their word, and I felt I played out an undervalued contract. \"That's the big thing. Right now, this is about principle with me and keeping your word and how you treat people. This is what I thought the foundation of the Patriots was built on. Apparently, I was wrong. Growing up, I was taught a man's word is his bond. Obviously this isn't the case with the Patriots.\" Logan Mankins put those feelings aside when he returned to the team Nov. 2, saying his focus was solely on football and helping the Patriots win. Yet in an interview with the Boston Herald last month at the Pro Bowl, Logan Mankins explained that it was now time to focus on his contract. \"I enjoyed playing there,'' Logan Mankins said of Patriots. \"The season's over. Now it's business time.\" Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPNBoston.com. Adam Schefter is ESPN's NFL Insider.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/news/story?id=6121690", "Entities": ["Patriots", "Logan Mankins"]}, {"title": "Considering the possibilities", "author": "Mike Reiss", "date": "Feb 15, 2011", "content": "This week's Patriots Mailbag includes a nice mix of topics, with one common thread: How can the team get better? Several scenarios are explored, covering free agency, the draft and trade possibilities. Although it's been a month since the Patriots' season ended, expect to see some stories popping up this week, as cornerback Devin McCourty will be at the Patriots Hall of Fame on Tuesday night (Feb. 15) as part of the Speaker Series, while kicker Stephen Gostkowski is making an appearance at a local hospital on Wednesday (Feb. 16). Until then, let's get to the questions... Q. Do you think that we are well stocked for the future at the wide receiver position? How much can we expect from Taylor Price? I know he is talented, but does he have the potential to be a replacement for Randy Moss? -- Allan (New Haven) A. Allan, I don't see Price as a speed guy in the Moss-type mold. He reminds me more of a David Givens style of receiver -- physical and fast, but not necessarily a straight-line burner. When I think of players who would be most affected by a potential lockout, he's one of the top ones on the list because I think another full offseason in the system is crucial for his development. As for if the Patriots are well stocked at receiver, I think they are. I do wonder if they have too much of the same type of receiver. Q. Hello Mike, do you see the Pats trying to get a deeper threat at WR just to boost the aerial assault down the field? I'm not even really sure who the potential free agents are. -- Bryan D. (Fort Wayne, Ind.) A. Bryan, I don't see it being as high of a priority as other areas, such as the offensive line, defensive line and pass rush, so I see any possible addition would be based on the opportunity available. If a top talent becomes available, maybe it moves them in that direction. As for possible free agents, student assistant Mike Rodak put together an informative capsule detailing the position and some of the options. Q. It seems there is a good chance Steve Smith is available from Panthers. I would think the Patriots should go after him and not worry about Price/Tate developing since you would have a Pro Bowl receiver instead. Your thoughts? -- John (Fort Myers, Fla.) A. John, if Steve Smith is available, I'd strongly consider it even though I don't view it as a top need. I think Steve Smith is a top competitor who could thrive with Tom Brady throwing him the ball. A big question would be the cost to acquire him, but the possibility is intriguing. Q. What moves, if any, do you see the Patriots making in free agency? Also, could you see the Patriots trading up in the draft to get an elite pass rusher like Robert Quinn or Von Miller? -- Chris (Worcester) A. Chris, the moves I envision the Patriots making in free agency are complementary, not huge splashes. A position like running back stands out to me. Players like Pierre Thomas (Saints) or Ricky Pat Williams (Dolphins) are those I could see being targets to team up with BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Danny Woodhead. As for a possible trade-up for Robert Quinn or Von Miller, it looks like Von Miller could be a top-five pick (Bills maybe), so I don't see that. If Robert Quinn is there in the 12 range, maybe the Patriots consider it if he checks out, but I still see it as a longer shot. Q. Pat Williams is going to be a free agent, and the Vikes may not try to keep him around. Could you see the Pats bringing him in and moving Vince to DE (ala Haloti Ngata)? -- Ryan (Baton Rouge, La.) A. Ryan, a player like Pat Williams could potentially fill a Ted Redskins -type 2003-style role as a first- and second-down run-stopper at nose tackle, although Dan Pompei's Sunday piece on the National Football Post website caught the eye this week. Pompei writes, \"Scouts tell me Pat Williams' play declined significantly in 2009, and that he no longer has the quickness that made him special. His strength is still there though, and it's difficult to find big bodies like him.\" Q. What are the chances that the Pats would draft quarterback Jake Locker in the second round if he's available? He doesn't have good accuracy, but Bill Belichick can fix anything. If they can get all the other stuff, why not take a chance? -- Samuel (Hockenheim, Germany) A. Samuel, I'd be surprised if the Patriots went that route with their high second-rounder (33rd overall). Maybe it would come into play more with the late second-rounder, but, even then, I think it's a stretch because they have Tom Brady (signed through 2014) and a promising backup in Brian Hoyer. One of the things I've heard Bill Belichick say over the years is that the two most important characteristics for a quarterback are accuracy and decision-making. If those aren't checking out, I think it's going to be tough for the Patriots to take that plunge. Q. Hey Mike, I think Logan Mankins is one of the top five guards in the game, but I don't understand how he can be upset with the franchise tag and making those comments publicly. I think he is a great player and I hope he is a Patriot for a long time to come, but with all that's going on why doesn't he just relax and see what happens after the CBA is addressed instead of stirring the pot already? He knows no matter where he lands he will be one of the top paid at his position. -- Mike (Boston) A. Mike, the biggest thing for players in Logan Mankins' situation is long-term security and I can't blame him for trying to maximize his earnings given the short span of players' careers. Logan Mankins is the type of player who is going to speak his mind and I think that's what we're seeing. Some players can keep it buttoned up even when they might be privately frustrated -- quarterback Tom Brady strikes me as that type of guy -- but Logan Mankins handles it differently. I can respect that because one approach doesn't suit all. No matter what happens -- franchise tag or long-term deal -- Logan Mankins knows he's assured of at least $10 million. That's a good start in my mind. Q. Mike, you have talked about the Patriots extending Logan Mankins a six-year deal for $8 million per year. While I would like to have Logan Mankins back, I am worried about the message this would send. Last year, Vince Wilfork did the right thing and was rewarded with a new contract. To give Logan Mankins, a less valuable player than Vince Wilfork, a larger contract extension after he held out for half a year is a bad idea. The problem with having half your roster being first- or second-year players is that they will all be up for new deals around the same time. With all the Patriots' young stars, I think they have to handle this situation very carefully. Thoughts? -- Drew (Fort Lauderdale) A. Drew, there might be something to this from a management perspective when one considers precedent. But I think so much changes from year to year, each situation has its own dynamic, and I'd argue that the Patriots already made their point with Logan Mankins by not budging last year. So my stance is that now the focus should be on striking an extension and letting bygones be bygones. Q. Can you judge how good a strength and conditioning coach, and his program is, by how many injuries a team has that year? In other words, if a team has a high number of (key) players hurt with bad injuries, does that mean the coach or his program are no good? -- Joe (New Milford, Conn.) A. Joe, I think it's a factor, but there is more to it than just that. A lot depends on the injury and how it happened. For example, a high number of pulled muscles might point toward a negative in the strength program. But on the flip side, a broken bone or blown-out knee is something that might have happened to anyone, regardless of the strength program. I'd use Tom Brady's knee injury from 2008 as another example. Just because Tom Brady was injured, I didn't think that reflected anything on the team's strength program. Q. With all the coaching staff movement, what is the status if Pepper Johnson? -- Jonathan Y. (Buel's Gore, Vt.) A. Jonathan, the Patriots have not revealed their full coaching staff. At this time, the assumption is that Johnson will return as defensive line coach. Q. I was bitterly disappointed after that horrible playoff loss to the Jets. That being said, I think they had perfect personnel to defend us and do not expect them to be as tough defensively next year. I still believe in Bill Belichick and Tom Brady and feel that a draft to upgrade the offensive line and pass rush would put us in great shape to run away with the division. Am I too confident? -- Jim (Greenville, S.C.) A. Jim, I don't think you're too confident. The Patriots have won eight of the last 11 AFC East championships. They still have a talented roster with a solid coaching staff. Q. Hello Mike, as for the Pats, I understand and agree with many of the issues that people have had the last few years however I think people are overlooking a few things. 1) The amount of overhaul Bill Belichick has done on the fly; 2) The sustained success they have had while doing so. Going back to 2008 I think Bill saw the need to start rebuilding with Jerod Mayo before Tedy Bruschi was gone. Then picking Patrick Chung for Rodney Harrison. I suspect we'll see someone like Muhammed Wilkerson or Cam Jordan to replace Richard Seymour this year, but the point is Bill is rebuilding for the future, and still maintained a record of 35-13 while doing it! Am I the only one impressed by the position he has the team in? -- Jeff M. (Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.) A. Jeff, I don't think you are alone. When I talk to people around the NFL, this thought is echoed. Bill Belichick's ability to have the Patriots remain competitive year in and year out -- and not be a window-of-opportunity team -- is widely respected. Q. Hey Mike I have a theoretical question for you. Do you think the Patriots would still make the Richard Seymour trade knowing that the first-round pick is number 17 and one of their biggest needs is DE? -- CJ (Milton) A. CJ, knowing what they know now, my sense is that the Patriots would have held off on the deal, tried to extend Vince Wilfork earlier, and then maybe used the franchise tag on Richard Seymour in 2010 (instead of Vince Wilfork). I think part of the reason they traded Richard Seymour is that they envisioned him as a one-and-done player -- likely to sign elsewhere in 2010 -- so they figured they'd get something for him while they could. Q. Mike, would you please try to give an update on Mike Wright's health? -- Bill (Mooresville, N.C.) A. Bill, I reached out to some people close to Wright last week and have yet to make the connection. I will keep working at it. Thanks. Q. Mike, I hate to even think about the business side of this looming lockout, but do you think that the owners are \"really\" pushing this 18-game schedule on us? It seems wildly unpopular to everyone, including the fans. I wonder if they keep building it up, but are prepared for it to be a \"major\" concession in the labor negotiations. Do you think there is anything to that? -- Bernie P. (Raleigh, N.C.) A. Bernie, I think that would be a pleasant surprise, but I don't see it headed in that direction. I think owners are set on the 18 games and the main reason is that it's the primary vehicle for them to grow revenue -- offer more product, get more money in return on those TV contracts. Q. In every sport except the NFL, if a guy gets hurt, he can be DL'd and come back later when he heals. In the NFL, once he's placed on the IR, he's done for the season. With a new 18-game schedule, that's a lot of time for a guy to recover. Wouldn't it make more sense to let a player come back once he's healthy? What's so different about the NFL? -- Peter (Ashland, Va.) A. Peter, that is one area owners are discussing, the possibility of a six-game injured reserve, or something like that. It would probably be the type of thing where teams could only have one or two players on that list at a time. Q. After reading through last week's mailbag, I don't agree with the flak that Robert Kraft was getting for his comments. He is the owner, shouldn't he have the right to comment about his team? I think he pales in comparison with owners like Mark Cuban or Jerry Jones. Your thoughts? -- Nate A. (Wildomar, Calif.) A. Nate, a few others wrote in with the same thoughts, the idea that Kraft is the owner and he can do what he wants. I view it as a fine line. An owner can obviously say whatever he or she wants, but considering how that potentially impacts the team, or its top coaches and players, is important too. Q. A point of emphasis for the Pats in 2010 seemed to be a return to \"The Patriot Way\" in the locker room. Although the players could be locked out by owners, do you envision any divide among players -- specifically the Patriots -- as labor tensions build in the coming months? -- Cathleen V. (Moose Jaw, SK) A. Cathleen, I don't see the labor situation causing any divide in the Patriots' locker room. From a league perspective, we've seen Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie speak out against the union, but I liked how NFL Players Association president Kevin Mawae explained it at the Super Bowl. He said it's just like a family and you're going to have some fights within the family, but in the end you're still in it together. I think it's going to be harder for the players to stay together if this drags out because not all are financially secure. If we get to that point, then I think we could see some tensions building. Q. This past year, we had a lot of youth on defense. After having another year of experience under their belt, how good can we expect this Patriots defense to be in 2011? -- Mike (Boston) A. Mike, that was one of the overriding themes I heard from analysts at the Super Bowl when it came to the Patriots. They kept saying how the defense is young and still developing. With Vince Wilfork, Jerod Mayo and Devin McCourty to build around -- and I might even put Patrick Chung in that category -- I only see them getting better. The Patriots ranked eighth in the NFL for fewest points allowed last season, so it wasn't all bad. Q. Hey Mike, I know there will be a draft this year, but if the new collective bargaining agreement isn't in place, do the rookies have to wait until the new CBA is done before any contracts can be done? Would a rookie wage scale be for this year's rookies or are they going to get mega-deals? -- Mike (Hull) A. Mike, those rookies would have to wait because teams wouldn't know the rules they are operating under. It puts those rookies in an uncertain situation. Q. What are the chances Randy Moss signs with the Patriots? -- Keith (Iron River, Mich.) A. Keith, I've thought in the past that if Moss takes the 2007-type approach, it has a slight chance of happening. But I think it would be a longer shot. I'd estimate 10 percent. Q. Mike, dare to give a Larry Fitzgerald -to-NE scenario another thought? The Cardinals need to rebuild and lack a competent QB, so getting rid of Larry Fitzgerald while they can redeem a few picks seems to be a no-brainer. Plus, the Pats have the picks/cap space and a need for a home-run WR. I know they address needs more through draft than free agency, but LF is only 27 with incredible upside. Is this really too crazy to unfold? -- Ian M. (NYC) A. I think it's too crazy, Ian. Larry Fitzgerald is one of their best players, if not the best, and I just don't see them giving him away.

PAUL, Minn. -- A county commission voted Tuesday to start talks with the Vikings and state lawmakers about the possibility of building a new football stadium in a suburb northeast of Minneapolis. The proposed site for the new stadium is a former Army ammunition plant in Arden Hills, a city about 10 miles from the Vikings' current stadium, the Metrodome, in downtown Minneapolis. The Ramsey County board's 6-1 vote makes it the first local government to express interest in hosting a new stadium as the Vikings prepare for a push at the state capital to replace the aging Metrodome. Team officials say the dome is outdated and no longer profitable as an NFL venue. With at least four sites under consideration, Ramsey County commissioners said the jobs and economic development that would come with a new stadium would outweigh the cost to county taxpayers, who likely would have to shoulder some of the construction costs. \"We have to create our own opportunities,\" county commissioner Rafael Ortega said. \"This would create many jobs, which is critical. This is an opportunity to get a lot of folks hired.\" Vikings executives have toured the site, and team vice president Lester Bagley praised Tuesday's vote as a positive step. But he was quick to caution that the Vikings have not yet committed to any site, and Bagley previously has noted that building at the current Metrodome site would be the most cost-efficient approach. Two other sites, one near the Vikings Twins stadium and another in a suburb northwest of Minneapolis, also are under consideration. The Vikings are seeking a state financing package that would require the team to pay for no more than a third of the cost of a new stadium. A new stadium likely would cost at least $700 million, and Gov. Mark Dayton said last week he'd like to see the team pay up to half of the total bill. The 2011 season is the last on the Vikings' lease at the Metrodome, and team officials have vowed not to play there after that. That has raised fears the team could move to another city seeking an NFL franchise. Some residents say the NFL is a hugely profitable business, and that the public should not be forced to subsidize stadiums for its private use. Greg Copeland, a St. Paul resident, interrupted Tuesday's commission meeting by saying that if the county tries getting taxpayers to shoulder even part of the cost of building a stadium, he will try to overturn the decision through a referendum. \"Zygi, take your team and go somewhere else, or else write a check and build a stadium yourself,\" Copeland said, referring to Vikings owner Zygi Wilf. Ramsey County officials stressed that Tuesday's vote did little more than get them a seat at the negotiating table. They said the vote will allow the county to more thoroughly study the Arden Hills site and to address questions about pollution, infrastructure and other concerns. Commissioner Janice Rettman, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said the plan is too far-reaching. \"We're making a decision here on limited information and a dream,\" Rettman said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6124463", "Entities": ["Vikings"]}, {"title": "Source: Bears' refusal disappoints Tice", "author": null, "date": "Feb 15, 2011", "content": "Bears offensive line coach Mike Tice was somewhat disappointed in the team's decision to deny the Titans permission to interview him for their vacant offensive coordinator position, an AFC source told ESPNBears.com's Michael Wright on Tuesday. Newly hired head coach Mike Munchak fired offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger along with two other assistants last week. Titans gave Mike Munchak the freedom to keep or hire anyone he wants. On Tuesday, the Titans announced that they gave the coordinator's job to longtime NFL assistant Chris Palmer. The source said that while Tice never has been responsible for play-calling duties in the NFL, \"going through that process\" of talking to the Titans would have been beneficial for Tice. The source added that although he'd rather not have Tice serving as an offensive coordinator in the conference, \"Mike would be good because I think he is a heck of a coach.\" Tice, a former tight end who played 13 seasons in the NFL, just completed his first season with the Bears and is signed through 2011. He spent the previous three seasons with the Jaguars. Tice also coached the Vikings' offensive line from 1997 until the last game of the 2001 season when he took over as interim coach after Dennis Green was fired.

Not by a long shot. For NFL players, the best part of their job is right now. The offseason. My guess is that most fans won't want to hear that. They want their players to be foaming at the mouth and excited about the start of the season in September. Or as pumped up about making a playoff run in January as they are. Understandable. And, in truth, there is a palpable sense of anticipation in the locker room as that season opener approaches and a recognition of the opportunity at hand whenever a team makes the postseason. But it still isn't as enjoyable as the offseason. Think about it in the context of your job. What is the best part about it? For most people, I would guess the answer would be paid vacation. Well, it is no different for NFL players. The time off the players receive from the end of their season to the beginning of the offseason conditioning programs that usually begin in mid-to-late March is the greatest perk of the job. In addition, of course, to the whole playing-football-for-a-lot-of-money thing. There are many reasons this downtime is so valued by players. First and foremost, it allows their bodies to heal. Even if they didn't suffer an injury that prevented them from playing, pretty much all players have something that is bothering them physically. And if they don't, I'd have to wonder what exactly they were doing out there. Even the parts of their body that don't have a specific injury need a break from the constant wear and tear. The offseason also allows players the freedom to come and go as they please. That's a real rarity for them, coming off a stretch from late July through early January in which they were essentially given a written itinerary of their schedule in increments that were sometimes as short as five minutes. That regimen exists seven days a week, although Tuesday being the \"off day\" allows for a bit of leeway in this regard. After a season, it's really nice to be able work out on your own, the way you want, when you want. Lastly, players have an opportunity to spend quality time with their family and friends, a luxury that is often difficult when working in a different city. And on every weekend. But don't just take my word for it. \"I took a full month off to recover,\" said Lions right tackle Corey Hilliard, who helped the Lions win their final four games of the season, \"and really just spent most of it with my wife and kids since we don't get to do that very much during the season.\" The time off between the end of the offseason program in late June and training camp in July is nice, as well, but not nearly the same. With training camp right around the corner, it is really difficult to relax and enjoy yourself in that time. Of course, the uncertainty brought about by the current collective bargaining agreement situation might be dampening the mood of some players in this year's offseason. Therein lies the irony. At some point, if there is a lockout, the players will grow so sick and tired of their beloved offseason that they will be champing at the bit to play football. After all, they all want to get paid. Let's all hope this offseason isn't an extended one. Q: Bill Cowher is a great football coach and would be an upgrade over a lot of current head coaches. However, he reached the big game twice, winning once and he did rack up losing seasons. With the current success of Mike Tomlin and the success of Chuck Noll, has Cowher's status come down a bit? He has turned down a lot of interviews in the past and this year he was not offered an interview. With his demands of wanting millions and complete control, as well as having a specific list of teams to coach, do you think he missed his chance to be a head coach again? Are owners and GMs now thinking his success came because of the Steelers' organization, not because of his coaching? Sharell from Raleigh, N.C. A: I don't think anyone can deny that Cowher is an outstanding coach. His track record speaks for itself. I agree with you, however, that the Steelers' success without him takes the shine off his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 a little bit. I also believe, as is the case with Jon Gruden, that we have a tendency to overstate the performances of coaches who have dynamic personalities. Gruden and Cowher are huge names, but are they really that much better as coaches than Super Bowl-winning Brian Billick? Are they better at all? I still believe, however, that Cowher will get a coaching job next offseason. But he might have to lower his demands a bit because of some of the reasons you mentioned. Q: I was wondering if the defensive line ever holds the offensive linemen in order to keep them from going to the next level on a run or from shifting off a double-team to a free pass-rusher? If this happens, is it ever called? Nate from Ithaca, N.Y. A: Yes, it is called defensive holding, and it does get called, but very infrequently. It got called even less this season as a result of the league's decision to move the umpires behind the offensive formation. That makes it significantly more difficult for them to truly identify whether the offensive linemen are being held by defenders. In fact, at one point midway through the season, I was told by an official that there had been only a handful of these calls made and that all of them had been called at the end of the first half and end of the game when the umpires moved back to their previous spot behind the defensive line. Logic tells you that means a bunch of fouls went uncalled. The most noteworthy defensive holding call this year went against Ravens rookie defensive tackle Terrence Cody at the end of the divisional playoff loss to the Steelers. Q: Ross, how about a 17-game schedule with the extra game being played on a neutral field? It could grow the game by putting \"mini schedules\" in San Antonio, L.A., Europe, etc. Might soften the blow of a Jaguars or Vikings losing its team. I'm concerned that 18 will lead to a dull end of the season. Scott from Fort Myers, Fla. A: You are preaching to the choir, Scott. I've been touting and in favor of the exact model you just laid out for well more than a year. There would still be three preseason games, which I think is probably the right amount, and I believe an additional bye week for each team would be a must, as well. This way, the television networks would still have the 19 weeks of NFL inventory they are looking for, and everyone would benefit from the increased revenue this would bring, but we would be adding only one additional game for the players and their bodies. Plus, teams wouldn't lose a home game by playing in London or any other neutral location. It also would help to spread the game and interest in different locales. Conceivably, eight of such games could be played in a place such as Los Angeles to help better determine the viability of trying to place a franchise there again. Q: What constitutes a \"pick\" on a passing play? I was at the Super Bowl and it was driving me nuts that the Steelers kept running quick passes, and I'm not sure how it came across on TV, but in person you could see that on almost all of the quick passes they ran there were DBs getting blocked by eligible receivers well before the ball got to its intended receiver. They were clearing running lanes for the receiver sometimes before the ball was even thrown. Maybe that's legal and I'm missing something. What's the rule on that? Charlie from Packers, Wis. A: Wide receivers have a right to run their pass patterns. If, in the course of running that pattern, they get in the way of a defensive back or he is unable to avoid them, so be it. Defenses will sometimes call that a pick, even though it is completely legal if the receiver does it correctly. Offenses prefer the term \"rub.\" If the receiver deviates from his route, however, with the intention of trying to make contact or get in the way of the defensive back, that is offensive pass interference, and it seems as if it is getting noticed and called more and more each year.

The Titans announced the hiring Tuesday afternoon, shortly before Mike Munchak is due to introduce new defensive coordinator Jerry Gray. Mike Munchak said in a statement through the team that he talked to a number of candidates and that Palmer fits what he wanted. Sources told ESPN.com that the Titans were rebuffed in attempts to interview Jets assistant Bill Callahan and Bears assistant Mike Tice for the position. \"Chris has a wealth of experience as a coordinator and a coach,\" Mike Munchak said. \"He is a great teacher of the game and has been around a variety of good coaches and winning football programs. He has helped develop many good quarterbacks and understands what that process is like, as he raised their games to a high level over time.\" That quality is very crucial for the Titans who plan to either release or trade Vince Young this offseason after five seasons with the franchise. The Titans want to draft a new quarterback and likely add a veteran as well. Palmer spent last season as head coach of the United Football League's Hartford Colonels. But he was head coach of the Browns for two seasons as an expansion franchise in 1999-2000, and he also spent seven seasons in the AFC South as offensive coordinator with Jaguars and Texans. He helped Mark Brunell post his highest passer rating of his career in 1997 at 91.2, and he was the first coordinator for the Texans as an expansion franchise working with David Carr. He was quarterbacks coach with the Giants between 2007 and 2009 working with Eli Manning, including their Super Bowl run when Eli Manning was named the game's MVP. Palmer worked with Bill Parcells with the Patriots between 1993 and 1996 as wide receiver coach and quarterback coach. He started working in the NFL with the then-Texans Oilers as the wide receiver coach between 1990 and 1992 -- when Mike Munchak was still a player for the franchise. They've known each other for 21 years, and Palmer called Mike Munchak an outstanding player and terrific coach. \"I am excited to be joining the staff. Offensively, I am very impressed with the personnel they already have in place, but it doesn't matter what level you are talking about -- high school, college, pro -- you are only going to be as good as your quarterback, and that will be something we work on,\" Palmer said. Palmer also was head coach at Boston University and New Haven in the college ranks. He even spent two years as an offensive coach for the USFL's New Jersey Generals and a year with the Montreal Concordes of the Canadian Football League.

The Chiefs said the former head coach of the Redskins signed a contract Tuesday and will work under new offensive coordinator Bill Muir. \"We are excited to finalize our coaching staff today with the addition of Jim Zorn,\" coach Todd Haley said. \"As a former head coach with more than two decades of experience playing and coaching the quarterback position in the NFL, Jim has a tremendous working knowledge of the game, and he will play a big role in the continued development of our football team.\" Zorn, 57, was released as Ravens's quarterbacks coach on Jan. 27 after helping Joe Flacco have his finest year as an NFL quarterback, including beating the Chiefs in the first round of the playoffs. Zorn's dismissal from Ravens caused Joe Flacco to rip the Ravens organization after the move. \"And when I look back on my season and our season as a team, I mean, we won 13 games. I felt like I had a pretty good year and you're firing the quarterback coach? It's kind of an attack on me, I feel like,\" Joe Flacco said. Muir was promoted from offensive line coach to offensive coordinator after Charlie Weis left for the University of Florida. It remains unclear whether Muir or Todd Haley will call plays. Zorn will be the first full-time quarterback coach the Chiefs have had since Todd Haley became coach following the 2008 season. Todd Haley, and then Weis, served unofficially in the position the first two seasons. Zorn was 12-20 as Redskins coach in 2008 and 2009. He made 106 starts in an 11-year playing career beginning in 1976 with Seahawks. He completed 1,669 passes for 21,115 yards and 111 touchdowns. After entering the league undrafted, he was with Seahawks for nine years. Improved play by quarterback Matt Cassel was a major reason the Chiefs made a six-game improvement last season and captured their first AFC West title since 2003.

Vincent Jackson, a Pro Bowler in 2009, can negotiate with other teams. If he receives an offer, the Chargers can either match the other club's offer or receive two first-round draft choices as compensation. \"There's some thought process that there might not be a franchise tag, but we'll wait and see,\" general manager A.J. Smith said, referring to speculation that the franchise tag might disappear whenever the NFL and the players' union agree to a new collective bargaining agreement. \"It is our intention for him to return in'11.\" Vincent Jackson, a 6-foot-5 receiver who had consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in 2008 and 2009, will receive a one-year tender at the average of the top five salaries among receivers last year, expected to be between $10 million and $11 million. The Chargers and Vincent Jackson also could negotiate a long-term contract, although the sides would have to get past last year's bad feelings. Vincent Jackson's original five-year contract expired after the 2009 season. But because 2010 was an uncapped year, he would have needed six seasons to become an unrestricted free agent. Unhappy that he didn't get a long-term deal, Vincent Jackson refused to sign a $3,268,000, one-year tender as a restricted free agent. He sat out the first seven games, then reported in time to serve a three-game suspension on the roster exempt list -- he was placed there in a hardball move by Smith. He was on the active roster for the final six games to accrue a season toward unrestricted free agency. When Vincent Jackson hadn't signed the tender by June 15, the Chargers slashed their offer to 110 percent of his 2009 salary, or $583,000. Due to the games he missed, he made less than $300,000 in 2010. \"It was really kind of the same decision as a year ago,\" Smith said. \"We wanted him to return and according to the system in'10, we tendered him $3.2 million. Because of his situation with where he was, that didn't go real well. Moving forward to'11, he is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent by the system. We looked at the team and at him as a player, and felt like we wanted to move forward with him in place in'11 with the franchise tag. We wanted him to be here last year and we want him to be here next year.\" In his first game back, Vincent Jackson lasted only two plays before limping off the field with a strained right calf. He missed the following game and finished the season with 14 catches for 248 yards and three touchdowns. With Vincent Jackson's off-field trouble -- two DUIs and being cited for driving with a suspended license and expired tags on the morning of the Chargers' playoff loss to the Jets in January 2010 -- it's generally believed the Chargers might consider it risky giving him a long-term deal. Vincent Jackson's agent, Neil Schwartz, didn't return a call seeking comment. Schwartz was critical of Smith when the Chargers didn't trade Vincent Jackson last season. \"I've heard there were ill feelings but that's been other people's version,\" Smith said. \"Our version was just business. It didn't go well on their end. We treated it as a business transaction and obviously they weren't happy with our position. With the franchise tag, we don't know what their position will be.

All he did, the saying goes, was catch touchdowns -- from a revolving door of quarterbacks, of which only one (Warren Moon) sported similar Hall of Fame bona fides. This past season was his fourth season of eligibility for Hall induction and it was his fourth season getting the Heisman stiff-arm rejection. Speaking of which, 1987 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, who when he retired after the 2004 season was one of only four receivers with 100 TD receptions, second in receptions and third in yards, got passed over again, too. During his 17-year career, he was a number 1 receiver facing double coverage every Sunday. And then there's Andre Reed (close to my heart as a native Billsnian), who actually made it to the final round of voting. Along with Hall inductees Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas, he was the third prong in Bills's no-huddle offense. He was the dude that caught the tough passes over the middle and turned them into big gainers and the dude every bit as responsible for the Bills' four straight Super Bowl appearances from 1990-1993 as Kelly and Thomas. This was his sixth year getting snubbed and told that he was great, but not that great. Are you catching the trend here, so to speak? Just for good measure, remember that it took Art Monk -- only the NFL's career leader in receptions when he retired -- eight years to finally make the Hall. There are 21 modern-era wide receivers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, compared to 28 running backs and 23 quarterbacks, even though more players play the receiver position. You can say that the recent class of wideouts are having a tough go at it when three of the very best can't get any love from the Hall. The receivers of the 1990s, perhaps the greatest era in league history, deserve more respect. In and around the NFL, there's a widely held axiom that the farther away from the ball, the less important a player is -- at least on the offensive side of things. So receivers, out there on their islands, tend to get dismissed. Making matters worse for some, the rule changes that went into effect in 1978, disallowing corners to get into as much physical jostling as before and allowing offensive linemen to use their hands in pass protection, have further devalued the position. \"Some believe the changes in the rules have tilted the competition in the receivers' favor,\" said Darryl Ledbetter, a Hall voter. \"Some of the thinking is,'If you can't touch them, they should catch the ball 80 times a year.' If you're a traditionalist, it's all about smash-mouth football and you look down your nose at the new rules, like it's not real football.\" Whether or not the three-plus decades of emphasis on the passing game appeals to your aesthetic or moral code of good football, there's still something awry with the general wide receiver dismissal we see with the Hall. Logic would tell us, after the rule changes, it became easier for receivers to get open, and NFL offenses reacted by passing more, which made game-changing number 1 receivers that much more important. Super Bowl XXV was the last time there were more runs called than passing plays. This year's champs, Packers, passed 39 times and ran 13 times against Steelers. Receivers' numbers have skewed upward and, if anything, their impact and importance on the field also has increased. Tell that to the Hall voters, though. \"That's the misconception that we just have to deal with at our position,\" Reed told me, days after his most recent disappointment. \"They think we're interchangeable, products of the system. But what they should really be asking is,'Did defenses have to account for you?' Did you produce?' Being the product of a system is not fair to me. It's a dig on me to say that I could only flourish because of the offense I was in. I still had to make plays.\" What's needed is a repositioning of the way the position is perceived. Ever notice the way the man on the other end of the pass is typically ignored or, at least, undervalued? We hear about the \"beautiful pass\" much more than we hear about the \"beautiful catch.\" Just how prolific would Kelly have been had his primary target, his go-to guy, not been a gifted player of Reed's caliber? Even the \"diva receiver\" stigma is one of unfair dismissal (and a perception the next generation of great receivers to become eligible will spend more time deflecting during their wait). The quarterback position more truly fits the definition, yet it's the receivers that get that tag with a scoff and irritated wave-off. \"Just shut up, go stand out there, run your route and catch the ball when the franchise quarterback throws it to you.\" As it stands now, wide receiver is the Rodney Dangerfield of the skill positions. And the Hall situation is going to get worse. The voters can only select five finalists each year, and as Michael Irvin alluded to, there's already a logjam. When Reed, Carter and Brown finally make it in (most think they will eventually), Terrell Owens, Isaac Bruce, Randy Moss, Marvin Harrison and Hines Ward will be among the backup of worthy cases. How much longer can voters say no to the standouts of the 1990s? Didn't they see Carter score 130 touchdowns? He must have been invisible on the field. No wonder today's receivers are break dancing or doing the Dougie and calling attention to themselves whenever they reach the end zone.

Why not Santonio Holmes or Braylon Edwards or Antonio Cromartie? They're all gifted, all entering their prime years and all free-agents-to-be, but the Jets decided to use the franchise tag on David Harris for this reason: He's a homegrown talent with a blemish-free image, and the Jets recognize they need to keep their own players -- the good ones -- instead of always buying and trading. Buying and trading almost got the Jets to the Super Bowl, but history shows that most championship teams cultivated their own talent, building through the draft. Exhibit A: The Packers, the Super Bowl XLV champions. Exhibit B: The Steelers, the runners up. The Jets can always say they have their \"Core Four,\" but it should be a \"Core Six\" or a \"Core Eight.\" David Harris, Darrelle Revis, D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Nick Mangold are terrific building blocks -- premier players with no off-the-field issues -- but the Jets need more players in that category. More homegrown players and fewer rentals. The offseason has barely begun, but there's every reason to believe the Jets will try to build with the players they have -- and, of course, the players they hope to retain. The David Harris move demonstrates that. For a team that was known last season as \"Hired Guns R Us,\" it is a strategy that sends a positive message. You could make the argument that Santonio Holmes is a better wide receiver than David Harris is a linebacker, but David Harris is the safer investment because of his sterling character. Considering the way last season went, with the seemingly endless soap opera of off-the-field shenanigans, the Jets need as many solid citizens as they can find. The Jets will definitely try to re-sign Santonio Holmes, and probably Braylon Edwards and Antonio Cromartie (they, too, have off-the-field questions), but the player they can least afford to lose is David Harris. General manager Mike Tannenbaum has been telling people for more than a year that he'll never let David Harris walk away, not on his watch. He's not the best player on defense -- Darrelle Revis is -- but he's the \"quarterback,\" the guy who makes the calls on the field. Continuity is important. Rex Ryan did a nice job of melding all the different egos on his team. But how many times did we hear about the \"communication issues\" on defense? There would be less of those problems if players had the chance to learn and grow in the system. Continuity will take on added importance if there's little or no offseason because of the labor strife. If they don't have time to properly train new players, the teams with the best old players with thrive in 2011. No doubt Tannenbaum has assembled a talented roster, but there's a dearth of young players because the Jets have drafted a league-low seven players over the last two years. The Patriots' total is 24, plus nine in the upcoming draft to the Jets' six. Eventually, those low numbers catch up to a team, especially with a salary cap. Teams can't act like the Yankees of the NFL. Because of the labor uncertainty, Trader Mike could be handcuffed for this year's draft -- and it may turn out to be a blessing. If there's no collective bargaining agreement, Tannenbaum won't be allowed to trade draft picks for players. He might actually have to use all of his picks, and those picks will have greater value if free agency occurs after the draft, which is the way it's looking. Some might argue that as a negative, considering some of Tannenbaum's smartest acquisitions came via trades. But based on where the team is now, the focus needs to be on getting younger. The organization already has decided to move second-year offensive lineman Vladimir Ducasse to right tackle, Damien Woody's spot for the last three years. Ducasse hasn't proven he can do the job, but the Jets loved him enough to take him in the second round in 2010 and they appear willing to take a risk because of that conviction. Just watch. That will be the theme of the offseason (if there is an offseason) -- building over buying, developing over importing.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/columns/story?columnist=cimini_rich&id=6124996", "Entities": ["David Harris", "Santonio Holmes", "Braylon Edwards", "Antonio Cromartie", "Jets", "Packers", "Steelers", "Darrelle Revis", "D'Brickashaw Ferguson", "Nick Mangold", "Rex Ryan", "Patriots", "Damien Woody"]}, {"title": "Dick LeBeau to return to Steelers", "author": null, "date": "Feb 15, 2011", "content": "Dick LeBeau said Tuesday he will be back for a 10th season as the Steelers' defensive coordinator.

The word waterfalls cascading through this cyberspace are the absurd products of Ben and Skin, and only Ben and Skin. The ideas expressed in this \"column\" in no way represent the thoughts of anyone else even remotely related to ESPN Cowboys. In fact, ESPN Cowboys has no idea what to make of any of this. So uhh, oh yeah, you can hear the aural version of this insanity every weekday from 9 a.m. to noon on 103.3 FM ESPN. Here come the Internet, sucka: Ben: It appears that Baby Jordan Warden Rick Carlisle is finally ready to free Rodrigue Beaubois from injury prison. Wait, which year is this? Actually, my sources are now indicating that it may not be Carlisle's fault this time. Let me get back to you on that once I can confirm. Regardless of who is to blame for his sophomore disappearing act, Super Roddy will soon return to save the day with a now overly legendary skillset and an extremely thick East Texas accent. Wait, which Beaubois are we talking about? This one may be real French all the time. Let me get back to you on that too. Skin: Quit putting everything off. The Mavs are ready to unleash some tiny French glide ball on an unsuspecting NBA. The players sounded like they were completely drunk off Roddy's practice performance Monday. Apparently reporters even saw a somewhat positive thought bubble briefly appear above Carlisle's head. This team is ridiculously deep; I'm wondering who'll get the minute squeeze. JET found his stroke again, J.J. Barea is playing like February is one long Puerto Rican Day parade and they still need the defense and all-around savvy of J Kidd and DeShawn. It'd be easier if they could rock hockey substitutions. Sorry I brought up hockey. Ben: How dare you bring up hockey. That's just flat out uncool, bro. I'm gonna let it slide this time because I'm so excited about the Mavs actually getting good news on the injury front. Although, truthfully from a truth standpoint, some people -- other people -- are worried that too much pressure will be put on Roddy's tiny, glass shoulders upon his return. But not me. I would never worry about the season completely riding on a smallish second-year player from another country who consistently and aggressively attacks the rim like he was shot out of a French war cannon. Skin: I see that as no worries for Monsieur B because the Mavericks are, at their worst, a giant collection of shoulders. This team is deep and everybody contributes. All Roddy has to do is offer another option. Look at Peja. He just played a game against the Rockets in which he wasn't covered once the whole night. And Roddy gets to the basket easier than Martin Lawerence slides into an old lady fat suit. Mavs are about to go Whodini and get to the good part. And also, hockey. Skin: Dude, can you believe the Stars? Me neither. So where has Jerry Jones been hiding out? This is his longest stretch of invisibility since Jimmy Johnson locked him in a closet for two weeks leading up to the'94 Draft. I remember the story of Jerry finally kicking down the closet door, sprinting down the hall, diving headfirst and sliding down the long draft table just in time to snatch the phone out of Jimmy's hands and scream Shante Carver into the phone. But he's gone, nowhere to be found. It's like he's David Lee Roth or something. I'm worried. Ben: Don't worry. My inside sources tell me Jerry is sliding across tables in a recently purchased furniture factory in Duncanville in preparation for this year's draft. He'll be ready. Considering that he's currently laugh fodder for his fellow owners, he's now under more pressure than ever to turn the organization around as quickly as possible. For that reason, my people at Valley Ranch are telling me that he's asked Wade Phillips to come back and dress up as a baseball catcher at the end of the draft table so he can Pete Rose style bulldoze him before yanking the phone from Jason Garrett and drafting Cam Newton. Skin: I could totally see that going down, especially since Cam Newton is viewed as a giant risk and The Cowboys are the NFL equivalent to unsafe sex. We joke about \"Crazy Jerry,\" but he's light years away from Al Davis. Isn't he? God please tell me he's not that kind of crazy. I've often heard he's crazy like a fox, but I worry that he's crazy like Samantha Fox and he plans to draft Full Force for defensive line depth. Ben: My sources tell me he's crazy like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction and even refers to the Vince Lombardi trophy as \"the Michael Douglas family rabbit.\" I guess I can understand why he's laying low, though. Things haven't been going well for Jerry since he murdered the Super Bowl. Ben: The shortest offseason in the history of Rangers baseballing is coming to a end. Although they're better than they were at this time last season, missing out on Cliff Lee leaves them less competitive than they were in October. On top of that, the greatest clubhouse in the world has now turned turbo-dysfunctional as Michael Young struggles to find his place on the team he captained just months ago. I still have extremely high hopes for this club,p including expectations that they'll acquire an ace (or two) before the trade deadline, but they'll need to get off to a fast start to maintain the momentum they generated with the claw and antler nation during their incredible postseason adventure. Skin: They're fortunate the AL West is less than intimidating. They have bigger rotation issues than a Don Nelson defensive scheme. I'm still confused why exactly Young is demanding a trade. None of it makes sense. I think he's going to have some big-time embarrassed regret about going public. The kind similar to what a young woman feels when she realizes her boss discoverd her Facebook pics documenting that wacky \"experimental exploratory\" fortnight she threw down sophomore year. It doesn't remind me of how The Stars are playing right now. Ben: If you keep bringing up hockey, I'm going to pass out from indifference. Why are you killing my baseball buzz with all this talk of ice soccer? By the way, how are the Hatcher brothers playing this season? Is Paul Newman still trying to get the most out of those whacky Modano triplets? I can't worry about any of those story lines right now. I'm too busy thinking about Wash sliding down a table, snatching the phone from the Angels and claiming the AL West again. Skin: I just don't see it going down like that. I see the doors flying open, but Wash kinda strolls in with some Curtis Mayfield playing in the background. He looks around the room, casually nods to anyone he deems worthy of acknowledgment, then drops a, \"step aside chumps cuz there ain't no time like the present.\" And then he reaches into his pocket and reveals some fine Corinthian leather claw gloves. He puts them on and then pulls out an armored truck money bag, reaches inside it and pulls out a bloody halo. He tosses it on the middle of the table to the sound of Angel executive gasps and says, \"y'all still want this?\" Then, in an unexpected turn of events, David Lee Roth comes swinging through the air singing the chorus to \"Panama\" only for Wash to take him out with a splitter right between the eyes. He then raises his voice and asks, \"who let that hockey cracker in here?\" And then baseball season starts. Or something close to that.

To ensure it doesn't happen, the Jets placed the franchise tag on linebacker David Harris, the team confirmed Tuesday. Of the players given franchise tags by their teams so far, only Manning and Michael Vick received the \"exclusive\" designation, barring them from talking with other teams, league sources told Mortensen and ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The \"non-exclusive\" designation, which David Harris received, means he can negotiate with other teams but the Jets would have the right to match the offer or receive two first-round picks if he signs elsewhere. The tag doesn't preclude the Jets from signing David Harris, their leading tackler, to a new deal before the season. Because of the labor uncertainty, general manager Mike Tannenbaum said recently that he doesn't expect to negotiate any long-term contracts before March 3, when the current CBA expires. If David Harris doesn't get signed by the start of the season, he will make the franchise tender -- the average salary of the five highest-paid linebackers in the league. In 2010, that figure was $9.6 million -- more than twice what David Harris has made in four seasons. David Harris didn't complain last season when D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Darrelle Revis and Nick Mangold signed new deals totaling more than $160 million. At the time, both sides acknowledged that the rules of the uncapped 2010 year made it difficult to re-sign veterans, especially those who weren't drafted in the first round, and they agreed to revisit the matter after the season. David Harris was a second-round pick out of Michigan in 2007. In many cases, the franchise tag creates ill will between the player and team -- but not in this case. \"This is a procedural move by the Jets,\" David Harris' agent, Brian Mackler, said in a phone interview. \"Based on what Mike and coach [Rex] Ryan have said, David is very important to the team. In no way, shape or form will this prevent us from our ultimate goal, which is to get David signed to a long-term deal. My expectation is that will get done once the CBA is done.\" Teams were able to begin using the franchise tag Feb. 10, but it's uncertain whether the tag will stand, what with the league's unsettled labor situation. David Harris, 26, probably will end up as the highest-paid linebacker on the Jets, ahead of Bart Scott ($8 million per year) and Calvin Pace ($6.75 million). Although his numbers dipped slightly in 2010, David Harris still led the team in tackles (119), and had three sacks and one forced fumble. His value is enhanced because he calls the defensive signals. He was voted team MVP by his peers. Basically, the Jets have removed David Harris from the open market, but they have many challenges ahead.

In addition, the Eagles said they have placed their transition tag on kicker David Akers. Under rules of the soon-to-expire collective bargaining agreement, franchise tags pay players the average of the top five players at that position. Transition tags pay players the average of the top 10 at the position, plus it gives teams the ability to match any offer given to the designated player in free agency. The Eagles went so far as to give Michael Vick the \"exclusive\" designation, barring him from talking with other teams. The only other player to have received the exclusive tag thus far is four-time MVP Peyton Manning by the Colts. It is uncertain if franchise and transition tags will be part of the next CBA. \"Michael Vick and David Akers were two of our most valuable players last year,\" coach Andy Reid said in a statement announcing the moves. \"They were well deserving of their Pro Bowl berths and we're happy to take this step to ensure that they'll be back in Eagles next season.\" ESPN.com reported last month that the Eagles would franchise Michael Vick. If franchise tags are upheld, the move will tie Michael Vick to Eagles for the 2011 season and put the Eagles in a better position to potentially trade backup Kevin Kolb, who wants to be a starter elsewhere next season. Logan Mankins received the Patriots' franchise tag on Monday. No players are expected to sign franchise tags while the NFLPA challenges their validity. Michael Vick made $5.25 million in 2010 but would make an estimated $20 million -- the average salary of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league -- as the Eagles' franchise player. Michael Vick was selected to start the Pro Bowl last month, his fourth trip to Hawaii in eight seasons. He is coming off a season of career highs in passing yards (3,018), passing touchdowns (21), rushing touchdowns (9), completion percentage (62.6) and passer rating (100.2).

Asking first-time defensive coordinator George Edwards to install a 3-4 defense despite inheriting a roster with a bunch of undersized front-seven players seemed like a bad decision way back in August, and nothing that happened during the season made it look any better. Edwards jettisoned the notion of a true 3-4 early on, subbing in Alex Carrington or Spencer Johnson on running downs, but it wasn't enough to prevent Bills from finishing dead last in our adjusted line yards stats. The Bills stuffed running backs at or behind the line of scrimmage only 13 percent of the time -- well below the league average -- and they were among the worst in the league at bringing down runners who reached the second level of the defense. During one particularly brutal three-game stretch, the Bills surrendered 689 yards on the ground, and they allowed at least 200 yards rushing in eight of their 16 games. Nose tackle Kyle Williams was selected to the Pro Bowl on the strength of his 77 tackles and 5.5 sacks. Although that wasn't enough to make up for the porous linebacker play behind him, he established himself as the centerpiece around which the new defense will be constructed.

The Texans were a terrible defensive team in 2010. They finished last in the league in Football Outsiders' DVOA ratings for pass defense. They gave up 24 or more points in 14 games, holding only the Rusty Smith -led Titans and the Trent Edwards -led (and Maurice Jones-Drew -less) Jaguars below that threshold. The solution: out with defensive coordinator Frank Bush and the 4-3 defense, and in with Phillips and the 3-4. The Texans probably have the right parts on the defensive line to run Phillips' version of a 3-4, which places less of a premium on large, space-eating defensive linemen.

Spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league e-mailed all the fans to offer either $5,000 or reimbursement for \"actual documented\" Super Bowl expenses, whichever figure is higher. The latest offer is the third and most valuable option for fans who had tickets but no seats in Cowboys Stadium for Packers's 31-25 victory against Steelers on Feb. 6. The NFL decided to extend another offer after commissioner Roger Goodell talked to fans over the past week, McCarthy said in an e-mail. The first offer was for $2,400 -- three times the face value of the affected seats -- and a ticket to next year's Super Bowl. The league soon added a second option of a ticket to any future Super Bowl plus airfare and hotel costs. \"As you may know, we have been reaching out directly to those fans who regrettably and inexcusably were unable to watch Super Bowl XLV from a seat in Cowboys Stadium,\" the e-mail to fans stated. \"In listening to your feedback, we have decided to offer a third option.\" The seating issue has sparked at least two lawsuits against the NFL and the Cowboys, and the lead attorney for one of the suits was unswayed by Tuesday's move. Attorney Michael Avenatti said the NFL still isn't offering reimbursement for all Super Bowl expenses, or addressing fans who were delayed or relocated to \"substandard\" seats. \"The NFL and its lawyers need to come clean with the fans as to their right to full compensation and sit down with us to fairly resolve this matter,\" Avenatti said. About 1,250 seats were declared unsafe hours before the Super Bowl, and the NFL scrambled to find new seats for about 850 fans. The remaining 400 were forced to watch from standing-room areas or on TV from places with no view of the field.

Of the players given franchise tags by their teams so far, only Peyton Manning and Michael Vick received the \"exclusive\" designation, barring them from talking with other teams. Peyton Manning will be due a salary over $23 million under the present formula. The Colts say they will continue to work on a long-term contract with Peyton Manning. Team owner Jim Irsay announced the decision Tuesday night on Twitter. \"We have placed the franchise tag on Peyton while we continue to negotiate a long term deal,\" Irsay wrote. Last year, Irsay promised to make Peyton Manning the NFL's highest-paid player. He has reiterated that position many times since then with one caveat -- if the Colts couldn't reach a new deal with Peyton Manning before free agency started they would use the franchise tag. The Colts did the same thing in 2004 before eventually agreeing to a seven-year, $98 million deal. The Colts then pulled the tag. Irsay hasn't backed down on either promise, and Peyton Manning, as he usually does, has remained silent about the contract. Three weeks ago, the Colts put their first formal proposal on the table. It was an offer Irsay and team president Bill Polian wanted to make last October, but Peyton Manning informed the team then, through his agent, that he did not want to start negotiating until after the season. The current offer is believed to be richer than the four-year, $72 million contract that Patriots quarterback Tom Brady signed in September. Tom Brady's contract also included $48.5 million in guaranteed money, and Irsay has called that deal the standard. \"It's not a normal negotiation, his legacy and our relationship, it's very unusual,\" Irsay said last month. On Tuesday, Indy decided not to wait any longer to make its decision. By \"tagging\" Peyton Manning, no other team can negotiate with the Colts' franchise quarterback. How critical is Peyton Manning to the Colts' success? In 13 seasons, he has broken all the franchise's career records for quarterbacks and has never missed a start. He's taken Indy to the playoffs 11 times, captured seven AFC South titles in eight years, won two AFC championships, one Super Bowl title and a Super Bowl MVP Award. And the Colts won more regular-season games in the past decade (115) than any team in NFL history. The move does free up the Colts to work on other contracts before the collective bargaining agreement expires March 3. The list of their potential free agents includes running back Joseph Addai, kicker Adam Vinatieri; Charlie Johnson, Peyton Manning's blind side protector; Melvin Bullitt, a key backup at safety who is ready to start; starting linebacker Clint Session and starting defensive tackle Dan Muir. Irsay also has promised \"significant\" announcements in the coming weeks. But, of course, none would be bigger than giving Peyton Manning the richest deal in league history in what could be his final NFL contract. \"It's important,\" Irsay said when asked about the importance of reaching a new deal with Peyton Manning. \"But it's something that you don't totally control, so I think you have to be prepared to work on your roster while you're doing that. That's a big part of the equation, but I think you have to be able and ready to shape your roster.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6125678", "Entities": ["Colts", "Peyton Manning", "Michael Vick", "Patriots", "Tom Brady", "Joseph Addai", "Adam Vinatieri", "Charlie Johnson"]}, {"title": "Plugging the Holes: AFC West", "author": null, "date": "Feb 10, 2011", "content": "On Wednesday, Football Outsiders began its Plugging the Holes series, in which it will target the offseason issues facing each team in the NFL by division.

The move from Josh McDaniels to John Fox at head coach was just one of many shape-shifts this offseason for the Broncos.

Mike McCoy and John Fox worked together in Panthers, and the first most obvious challenge they'll face together in Broncos -- especially with the franchise's legendary quarterback overseeing the process -- will be choosing a franchise quarterback. Kyle Orton put together the kind of hyped-up numbers every quarterback seems to attain under Josh McDaniels. He was remarkably consistent in each game, with career-high totals for the Broncos in 2009 and 2010.

Going into 2010, Cundiff was a run-of-the-mill kicker who had bounced around the NFL. Between game rosters and preseason, he had suited up for nine teams in nine seasons. Cundiff had just 11 touchbacks in his career, on more than 200 kickoffs. So it was a shock, to say the least, when Cundiff had 40 touchbacks on 79 kickoffs in 2010. Cundiff was the first kicker to have a touchback percentage of more than 50 percent since the kickoff line was moved back from the 35-yard line to the 30 in 1994. FO metrics scored Cundiff's kickoffs as 15.0 estimated points of field position over average; Olindo Mare was second at 7.7 points. Cundiff's touchback rate went from 6 percent to 51 percent, a rise of 45 percentage points.

Even before 1994, it was extremely rare for a kicker to hit touchbacks half the time. It's safe to say that nothing like this has happened before.

In an op-ed piece posted Tuesday on NFLlabor.com, Goodell writes: \"The hard work to secure the next NFL season must now accelerate in earnest.\" Noting that the current collective bargaining agreement expires March 4, Goodell says he \"cannot emphasize enough the importance of reaching agreement by then.\" Goodell says owners need more money to offset \"costs of financing, building, maintaining and operating stadiums.\" He adds: \"We need new stadiums in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, 49ers, Raiders and Chargers.\" The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues; under the old deal, the owners receive $1 billion off the top, and they want to increase that to $2 billion before players get their share. Former players have also weighed in with their concerns. In a letter obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday, NFL Hall of Famers Jack Youngblood and Bruce Smith asked NFL owners to promise not to lock out players even if a new collective bargaining agreement isn't reached by the time the current one expires at the end of the day March 3. Youngblood was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001, Smith in 2009. Their letter was addressed to \"Owners of the National Football League\" and sent Jan. 31 to Goodell at league headquarters in New York. \"As former players, it is crystal clear that the vast popularity and financial success of football means that a lock out cannot be in the interest of anybody involved, particularly the fans who support the game,\" Youngblood and Smith wrote. \"We understand the need for both sides to create pressure, but also know that at times it is important to decrease tenor and tone in order for the right deal to be made in a non-emotional atmosphere.\" They noted that the players' union already \"pledged to not strike.\" \"By making the parallel commitment,\" they wrote, \"the owners would create the breathing room for a deal to be struck.\" That exact wording also was used in a Feb. 7 letter from Chiefs, Mo., Mayor Mark Funkhouser to Clark Hunt, the owner and chief executive officer of that city's NFL team, the Chiefs. Indeed, Funkhouser's two-paragraph letter to Hunt uses phrases throughout that echo the letter to Goodell from Youngblood and Smith. Mayors or city officials from at least five sites of NFL teams have written letters to the league or a club official to argue against a lockout. And in yet another letter, the advocacy group Sports Fan Coalition wrote Tuesday to the NFL and union, asking that its leadership be allowed to listen in on bargaining sessions between the sides. \"We are not asking for a seat at the negotiating table -- although we believe fans deserve one -- but merely to be present in the room,\" the letter said, \"so that we may inform fans across the country about the state of ongoing negotiations and ensure that progress is being made towards an agreement that ensures a central consideration of fans.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6125144", "Entities": ["49ers", "Raiders", "Chargers", "Chiefs"]}, {"title": "NFL denies NFLPA's claim of talks", "author": "Chris Mortensen", "date": "Feb 16, 2011", "content": "As part of the increasing communication gap between the two sides, the NFL has denied there were any collective bargaining negotiating sessions scheduled this week, as a union official had claimed Monday.

You have a league tied in knots over a labor agreement set to expire, public relations haymakers being thrown by both sides, uncertainty everywhere. But somewhere in the middle of the mess, there's still an NFL draft to look forward to. The draft, however, could be impacted. If the NFL Players Association and the owners don't agree to a deal, it will put a stop to draft-pick deals that involve players already in the league. Last year, pre-draft deals involving names like Brandon Marshall and Donovan McNabb shifted the board. For my second mock of the year, the biggest attention-getter will be the rise of Cam Newton, who now is going within the first five picks. After that, there is a ton of movement, so as always, I look forward to the -- ahem -- helpful commentary and debate. (As always, an asterisk denotes non-seniors.) Record: 2-14 * Nick Fairley, DT, Auburn Nick Fairley is hanging tough as my number 1 overall player, remaining atop the latest Big Board. This is a defensive lineman with small weaknesses, such as leverage and composure, but he masks those as a dominant presence against the run, a remarkably instinctive pass-rusher who can overwhelm the opposition with speed, power or hand skills and explosiveness that would impress the late Reggie White. A safe pick in a draft position that will be hard to move from. And as I've said, a slight mean streak in a DT isn't the worst trait. Ask the Lions about Ndamukong Suh. Record: 4-12 * Da'Quan Bowers, DE, Clemson I can see Broncos looking at Patrick Peterson here, but remember this is a team that could be looking at a system change up front. And in that vein, in Bowers the Broncos can take a player who could be a dominant pass-rusher as a 4-3 defensive end or stand up as a 3-4 outside linebacker. He is the most pure pass-rusher in the draft and can quickly add production at either spot. Further, given health and system changes, Broncos can't assume great production from Elvis Dumervil. Bowers makes a lot of sense and can stay in orange. Record: 4-12 * Cam Newton, QB, Auburn From the day he landed on the Big Board for the first time, I've said that Cam Newton's physical skills and underrated ability as a passer could lead him all the way to the top of the draft. In Bills, what you have is an ideal foundation for his career. The Bills can keep Ryan Fitzpatrick around and develop Cam Newton at a slower pace. But given Cam Newton's total package of skills and size, and his proven ability as a guy who can adapt, deal with adversity and win, he represents a real possibility to land in the top five. Record: 4-12 * A.J. Green, WR, Georgia It's hard to find a safer pick at the wide receiver position in recent years. A.J. Green already has imposing size, making him a deep threat and obvious red zone option, but he also offers refined route-running, good speed and the ability to bring down anything thrown in his direction. As for the need, it's doubtful that either Chad Johnson or Terrell Owens will be back for Bengals, leaving a big void on the outside. Regardless of what happens with Carson Palmer, the Bengals need to find a new target, and A.J. Green is a safe option. Record: 5-11 Von Miller, OLB, Texas A&M Joey Porter is unlikely to be back, and Von Miller would represent an immediate pass-rushing upgrade on the edge of Cardinals's 3-4 scheme. The Texas A&M standout made his name in 2009 as a sack artist but developed a range of skills in 2010 and has become a complete player. He stands up well against the run and drops into coverage seamlessly.

Bottom line: Never be surprised to see changes at this stage, and that's before the combine, which is just two weeks away. Among the big movers this week is Cam Newton, who I debuted in the top 10, only to see him fall and then bounce back up as the scouting depth grows.

Even though the NFC West has produced two Super Bowl teams in the past six years, the division has done more to pump up other divisions than itself. And with quarterback questions in Seahawks, 49ers and Cardinals, it's hard to believe the NFC West drought will end anytime soon. If that's the case, expect teams in the NFC East and AFC North (those divisions go head-to-head with the NFC West) to have bloated records and statistics in 2011. The cycle started four years ago. The Rams were down. The Seahawks had lost their Super Bowl luster. Mike Nolan's transformation of the 49ers wasn't working. Only the Cardinals -- once Kurt Warner took over at quarterback -- were on the rise. Over the past four years, the NFC West averaged a staggering 19 games below.500 per season in nondivision games. The NFC West was 12-28 in 2007, 10-30 in 2008, 12-28 in 2009 and 13-27 in 2010. Don't get overly excited about the division's improvement to 13 wins last year, a mark bolstered by a 7-9 record against the weak AFC West. The NFC West went 6-18 against everyone else. In 2011, NFC East teams will be licking their chops to get another shot at the NFC West. In 2008, the NFC East went 12-4 against the NFC West, and the Giants and Eagles had their highest-scoring offensive teams in the past 10 years, thanks, in part, to the NFC West. One of my new tricks in figuring out schedule-related trends is seeing where a down division such as the NFC West can help good teams achieve a 7-3 record in nondivision games. The way the schedule is planned, teams get four games against a division within their conference and another four games against a division in the other conference. If playing a bad division can give a team a 3-1 or 4-0 record in those games, bingo. That's why it was easy to forecast that the winner of the NFC South in 2010 was going to be the number 1 seed (the Falcons) and the runner-up (the Saints) would be the highest-seeded wild-card team. The NFC West went 3-13 against the NFC South last season. Thanks to those wins, the Bucs and Saints went 7-3 in nondivision games and the Falcons went 8-2, giving the division three teams with 10 or more victories. The NFC West Factor really came into focus in 2008, with a huge assist from the AFC West. That year, the AFC East had the perfect storm of scheduling success, drawing the NFC West and AFC West. The AFC West bottomed out in 2008. The Chargers won the division with an 8-8 record, and the division went 11-29 in nondivision games. Thanks to playing both western conferences, AFC East teams had inflated records. I remember projecting before that season that all four AFC East teams could go 7-3 in nondivision games because of the western scheduling draw. The Bills, Dolphins and Patriots all cooperated by doing just that. The Jets went 5-5, partially because of road losses to the 49ers and Seahawks in December, when Brett Favre's biceps injury robbed him of his throwing accuracy. A healthy Brett Favre would have pulled off those two wins and put the Jets at 7-3. Better days might ahead for the NFC West. The Rams should be a budding power with Sam Bradford at quarterback. Jim Harbaugh and Pete Carroll have come out of the college ranks to rescue the 49ers and Seahawks. If the Cardinals can get any kind of quarterback play, Ken Whisenhunt has shown he knows how to win games, after taking the Cardinals to the Super Bowl in the 2008 season. But the NFC West's inability to win on the road can't be overcome in one season. The four-year cycle of road futility bottomed out in 2010, when the four NFC West teams combined for a 6-26 road record. In 2007, 2008 and 2010, the NFC West teams had only seven nondivisional road wins -- combined -- over those three seasons. An elite quarterback can be the difference in winning those nondivision road games. Warner pulled off a 6-2 road record during the Cardinals' Super Bowl run in 2008. Other than that one run, no NFC West team has done better than 3-5 on the road in the past four years, and there are more 2-6s and 1-7s than you can imagine. Sam Bradford may be one of the league's next elite quarterbacks, but he was a rookie last year in a division that didn't produce a team with a winning record. With three other teams in quarterback transition, the NFC West drought should continue. The last time the NFC West had a winning record in nondivision games was 2003. Until that changes, divisions drawing the NFC West will often get higher seeds in the playoffs. Keep that in mind when looking at the fortunes of the NFC East and AFC North.

Marcus Stroud's departure was not considered a surprise after the 10-year NFL veteran struggled in making the transition in Bills's switch to a 3-4 defensive scheme. Marcus Stroud was scheduled to make $10 million in base salary over the final two years of his contract, including $4.5 million next season. Marcus Stroud also proved expendable after the Bills selected defensive linemen Torell Troup and Alex Carrington in the second and third rounds of the draft last year. Both are expected to compete for additional playing time next season. The Bills had no comment aside from announcing Marcus Stroud's release. Marcus Stroud is a three-time Pro Bowl selection, who completed his third season in Bills after being acquired in a trade with Jaguars in March 2008. He showed up to training camp in July leaner in preparing to make the switch from defensive tackle to end in the Bills' new scheme. However, he struggled along with an entire defense that finished 24th in the NFL in yards allowed and last in yards rushing. The Bills finished 4-12 and opened the season losing their first eight games.

Roy Williams is a man the Cowboys gave up three draft picks for before signing him to a five-year contract extension worth $45 million in October 2008. But each year he's been with the Cowboys it seems the team doesn't want to use him. His availability in the game plan decreased in the last few weeks of the 2010 season due to an injured groin and a lack of trust in his abilities. It's really a shame because this trade is looking like one of the worst in franchise history. Roy Williams' status with the team, however, is secure on three fronts: money, lack of a number 3 receiver and Dez Bryant. If the Cowboys release Roy Williams, it's a $12.9 million cap hit. That's a large sum of money to absorb for a player not participating for you. Dez Bryant had a fantastic rookie season before suffering a fractured ankle at Colts on Dec. 5. Dez Bryant, however, had some problems in grasping the playbook and staying healthy. He battled nagging injuries most of the year, which could be attributed to him not playing in nearly a year due to his suspension in college, before his season ended early. And say you do let Roy Williams go. Who is the Cowboys' number 3 receiver? Sam Hurd? He wants to be a receiver full-time, and the team values him more on special teams. Kevin Ogletree? He moved up the depth chart in Jason Garrett's mind as the season progressed but didn't do enough to leave you with an impression. A receiving corps of Austin, Roy Williams and Dez Bryant looks better than Austin, Dez Bryant and??? If the Cowboys are going to forge past their 6-10 record, they need dependable playmakers on the field. The Cowboys have gotten away with using Jason Witten (league-leading 38 fourth-quarter catches last year) and Austin (team-leading 1,041 receiving yards) as the primary receiving threats. If you add Dez Bryant's emerging talents, then the Cowboys should have an outstanding passing game. Which brings us to Roy Williams. If he's used the right way, and he wasn't late in the season, he can become a productive member of this team. Roy Williams had five touchdowns the first five weeks of the season and none the rest of the way. Jason Garrett was irked by some comments Roy Williams made about the direction of the offense and the two had a chat about it in the last week of the regular season. It appears Jason Garrett and Roy Williams are on the same page now. Then, of course, there was that costly fumble against Saints on Thanksgiving Day that eventually cost the Cowboys a victory. One thing appears certain: The Cowboys need Roy Williams because he's stable and they can't afford to take the financial hit. So if you want Roy Williams to be released, it might not happen. Now to the mail. Q: Do you think the Cowboys will get a chance at Raiders free agent cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha? -- Daniel Ciccarone (Eagleville, Pa.) A: I doubt it. Later on in the mailbag, we'll address Terence Newman's status with the club. Nnamdi Asomugha will command a big-money contract. It could average close to $9 million a season, and that's nearly what the Cowboys are paying Terence Newman. Nnamdi Asomugha would be a fantastic pickup, but Jerry Jones said during the Super Bowl he's hopeful Mike Jenkins and Terence Newman can return to their 2009 Pro Bowl form. Q: I'm still on the fence about the offensive line. To me, they just seem old and don't pack as much punch as they did one or two seasons ago. I think Doug Free, Kyle Kosier and Gurode have earned the right to stay. Marc Colombo could be replaced. But how do you see Jerry dealing with this? Do you think he'll go to the draft? Are there any worthy offensive linemen out there in free agency? -- Bo (Vikings) A: The left side of the offensive line is unsettled with the pending free agency of left tackle Doug Free and left guard Kyle Kosier. It appears the Cowboys want to keep Doug Free. As for Kyle Kosier, we're not sure. He's in his 30s and there might be a better, younger solution out there. The right side had its issues in Marc Colombo and Leonard Davis. Marc Colombo is a question mark regarding his status for 2011 due to health reasons. Leonard Davis was benched earlier in the season but bounced back nicely the rest of the way. If you can find a quality tackle in the draft, then get him. As for free agency, there are plenty of vets on the market, but here are two names worth looking at if they become unrestricted free agents: Justin Blalock and Nick Cole. Q: Why don't they give Stephen McGee more of a chance at quarterback? I think in his limited opportunities he has shown very \"smart\" football skills. By this I mean he seems to know when to get rid of the ball out of bounds, just to throw it away, or when to take off scrambling, which he did very well in his last showing. I am a Tony Romo fan and I even like Jon Kitna.... However, McGee is a little bigger quarterback who has some legs and smarts, and many of the passes he missed were more of a timing thing. He can see over the line a little better, where Tony Romo has made many mistakes in the same circumstances which I think should be attributed to his size. I just think given the opportunity, he could be the QB we are looking for to take us to the February game. If not this year but in the near future. -- Charlie Brown (Mountain View, Wyo.) A: Charlie, I thought the team waited too long to see what it had in McGee last year. That's nothing against Jon Kitna, but at some point you need to view the younger players. McGee looked good down the stretch, especially late in games, and almost won the Cardinals game on Christmas night. It will be interesting to see how much he plays in the preseason and if he can challenge Jon Kitna for the number 2 job. Not sure if McGee is ready to take over for Jon Kitna, but this is an important year for him in regards to his development as a quarterback. Q: Calvin, I respect your opinion. Please tell me why the heck Dave Campo is still employed in this organization? He clearly needs to go, no excuses. -- Anthony Varrone (Jaguars, Fla.) A: I guess you didn't like Campo's work in Jaguars? It's easy to blame the coaches when things go wrong in the secondary. The safety play wasn't very good for the bulk of the year and the cornerbacks were inconsistent. It's amazing when you think about the talent the Cowboys have in the secondary and how inconsistent it was. Campo is a good coach, but it's clear the Cowboys were looking for his replacement when they offered Ray Horton, the Steelers' secondary coach, a job. Part of the problem with the defensive backs was the lack of a consistent pass rush in 2010. If you get to the quarterback, it takes pressure off the secondary. You can't expect the secondary to cover receivers for an entire play. It's almost impossible. Campo's unit has to perform better in 2011. No doubt. Q: With the ninth pick, what skill position do the Cowboys draft? If Cam Newton falls to the number 9 spot, do the Cowboys trade down to get better value? -- Teofilo (Austin, Texas) A: Stephen Jones said it best the day the team hired Jason Garrett: \"Take the best player available.\" When you're coming off a 6-10 season, you have holes all over the place. If you can get one of those topflight cornerbacks, then do it. If you can get an outstanding pass-rusher to challenge Anthony Spencer, do it. Now if Cam Newton is available, you bypass him. I have nothing against drafting a quarterback, yet it's clear Tony Romo isn't going anywhere. I wouldn't trade down either. Get the best player for your team at number 9. Q: With the emergence of Josh Brent, is there a belief in the organization that he could become the starting nose tackle next year and move Jay Ratliff out to defensive end? I have always thought he would be even more disruptive if he was working a little more in space. -- Colin (Redding, Conn.) A: I agree it would be nice to see Jay Ratliff perform with more space off the edge. He's still an excellent nose tackle, and Rob Ryan shouldn't give up on him. Somehow Jay Ratliff didn't play up to his potential last year, and that needs to be addressed. Brent showed tremendous strides in 2010 and should back up Jay Ratliff in 2011. Q: In your opinion, which line will have a better 2011, the O-Line or the D-Line? -- Billy Jones (Texans) A: This is a tough question. One of the toughest of the offseason. The offensive line needs some new faces, at least two new players. It doesn't matter what position it is, but the O-line needs some younger, healthier bodies. The defensive line has some problems with three ends becoming free agents, so the franchise has to do something at that level. The new defensive line coach, Brian Baker, should help the line improve. Julius Peppers loved him when he was in Panthers. I would say to expect the defensive line to improve. Q: Cal, I think Cowboys needs a free safety... in this draft because we can't have another year of Alan Ball getting beat deep. He is not the answer at free safety. -- Trub (Camden, N.J.) A: Alan Ball struggled last year. We all know this, but he might return to the team in a backup role. He's very athletic and he did play better toward the end of the season, so there's hope for him. In terms of the draft, two of the better free safeties in this draft are Quinton Carter of Oklahoma and Rahim Moore of UCLA. Those players are not getting first-round projections, so you can probably get one of them in the second day of the draft. Q: How much is Terence Newman's contract for next season? Cut him. The following question proves why. Will Nnamdi Asomugha's price range be that out of the realm of Jerry Jones' pocket for him not to pay the man to follow in Deion's HOF footsteps? -- Brad (Saints) A: OK, Brad, here's the deal with Terence Newman. He's signed through 2014 and he's scheduled to make $8 million this year. Terence Newman's cap number is $10 million. I think the Cowboys will keep Terence Newman this season. The price tag for Nnamdi Asomugha is too high. There are some quality corners coming out in the draft this spring and you should look at one of them. Q: If these three players are the best available on the board and they all fit a need, who do the Boys pick? Prince Amukamara CB, Marcell Dareus DT, Nate Solder OT? -- Raul (El Paso, Texas) A: Marcell Dareus won't be around at number 9. Nate Solder is projected to go later in the first round unless something changes at the combine, so that leaves Prince Amukamara. Yes, he would be a nice pickup at number 9, unless the Cowboys think the pass rush needs help.

Kindle -- a Cowboys native and former Texas linebacker -- recently began working out four days a week at Michael Johnson Performance. \"It's going well,\" Kindle said, \"I'm just preparing for whenever this lockout issue is settled so when we do go back I'll be prepared and ready to go.\" A year ago, Kindle called this facility in suburban Cowboys home leading up to the NFL Scouting Combine and he ended up being selected in the second round by the Ravens. Three days before camp started he fell down two flights of stairs at a friend's house, fracturing his skull. He was not under contract and was signed to a one-year, $320,000 deal before spending the year on injured reserve. Kindle, who finished his Longhorns career with 176 tackles -- 43 for loss -- and 16 sacks, said he and the team are seeking second and third opinions on his injury before he can be cleared for contact drills.

Acquired from the Broncos in a multi-player deal prior to the 2009 season, Jay Cutler threw a career-high 26 interceptions and posted a career worst 76.8 passer rating as the Bears finished 7-9. Turner was fired immediately following the season. Jay Cutler's play improved this past season under the guidance of new offensive coordinator Mike Martz, but the quarterback had a few memorably bad moments, including the first half of the NFC Championship Game against the Packers at Soldier Field. \"I don't want to get too much into [Jay Cutler's two seasons in Bears], other than to say you just got to give him time and get him surrounded by good people, which they're doing,\" Turner said Wednesday on \"The Waddle & Silvy Show\" on ESPN 1000. \"But you just got to give him time, it takes time for everybody. We all know the talent that he has, and I think it shows on the field.\" Turner was candid in stressing the importance of having a number 1 receiver. He spent the 2010 season overseeing the Colts' wideouts, working every day with perennial Pro Bowler Reggie Wayne. During his second stint in Bears (2004-09), Turner never had a receiver make the Pro Bowl -- Johnny Knox made it in 2010 as a kick returner. \"I don't think [you can win at a high level without a receiver like Reggie Wayne],\" Turner said. \"It would be really, really difficult. You have to have that guy you know you can go to, a guy that's going to be there every game for you, making big plays. You have to have that. If you have that, it takes so much pressure off the other guys and enables you to run the ball. \"If you have a guy like that, it alters your defensive gameplan a little bit.\" Besides failing to protect the football, the 2009 Bears offense was unable to muster much of a ground game. Coming off a successful rookie season, running back Matt Forte averaged only 3.6 yards per carry during an injury plagued year. A healthy Matt Forte averaged nearly a yard more per carry and eclipsed 1,600 all-purpose yards the year after Turner's dismissal. \"Oh, I think [Matt Forte's injuries] did factor in, no question about it,\" Turner said. \"I'm happy for the success he had this year. I did have a chance to see those guys several times and I was happy that Matt was playing the way we know he's capable of playing. \"In 2009, Matt's got a lot of pride and he's a tough guy, so he tried to go out there and play, but he just didn't have the burst. He just wasn't healthy. I think toward the end of the year he started to get healthy. But when you have a guy like that, now they're going to commit to stopping the run and it opens up the outside. His receiving ability gives you so much more flexibility, things that you want to do and were able to do with him. When he was hurt you just couldn't do them. But when he's healthy and playing like he's playing, it makes everyone else around him better and opens up some other things.\" Jeff Dickerson covers the Bears for ESPNBears.com and ESPN 1000.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6129020", "Entities": ["Colts", "Jay Cutler", "Bears", "Broncos", "Packers", "Reggie Wayne", "Johnny Knox", "Matt Forte"]}, {"title": "Trace Armstrong sees lockout looming", "author": "Jeff Dickerson", "date": "Feb 16, 2011", "content": "Count former NFLPA president Trace Armstrong among those who believe the current CBA will expire before a new deal gets done between the NFL players and owners. \"My personal belief is that there will be a lockout, and we will certainly miss a portion of the offseason,\" Armstrong told ESPN 1000 on Wednesday. \"So, if you're a new coach, if you're Mike Munchak or Jason Garrett or Jim Harbaugh, there is a strong possibility you may not even get to see your players until August. How much is that going to hurt you? It's going to hurt a lot from a competitive standpoint. So I think the season, in some sense, will be impacted no matter what.\" A 1989 first round draft choice (12th-overall), Armstrong spent five years with the Bears before making stops in Dolphins and Raiders. He retired after the 2003 season with 106.5 sacks and one career Pro Bowl selection. The standout defensive end served as the president of the NFLPA for eight seasons (1996-2003), and was strongly considered for the NFLPA executive direction position that eventually went to DeMaurice Smith following the passing of Gene Upshaw in August 2008. \"I think there will be all kinds of twists and turns,\" Armstrong said. \"When [I] came in the league in'89, we came in the league without a CBA. Is it possible that there's football without a CBA? Sure it's possible. This thing will take all kinds of twists and turns between now and when they'll get a deal done. Back in'89 we thought we had an idea of how we would get to 1993 and the Reggie White settlement and free agency and all those things, but what ended up happening in the end only looked a little bit like what our plan was in 1989, so I don't think anybody can answer that. I think both sides will have to be flexible, both sides are going to have to be creative and I think we'll end up with some solutions, quite honestly that have not been part of deals in prior years. \"My hope is that we don't miss games. At the end of the day, that's what we all want.\" Armstrong, now an agent, refused to speculate about what he would have done differently if awarded the executive director's job, instead of Smith. \"No, I can't get into that,\" Armstrong said. \"There are people involved in those discussions and you just got to believe they are doing what they think is best to represent their constituents. So, I don't want to get into Monday morning quarterback. It's a great game, the players are the game and I hope a system gets put in place that promotes parity and that protects and rewards players who are out there every Sunday sacrificing to play the game.

Robert Weintraub continues with the NFC South. In this edition, Outsiders looks at the Falcons' team speed, the Panthers' QB situation, the Saints' defensive potential and the Bucs' status as a 2011 sleeper. The Falcons never were fully embraced as a Super Bowl threat in 2010, and that's because they were never fully feared. The reason was their lack of explosiveness. Despite playing on the fast track at the Georgia Dome, Falcons had only one scoring play of more than 40 yards all season. The Packers wiped out the Falcons in the playoffs with a much faster team -- Falcons appeared to have been built for the frosty mud of Lambeau Field. Save for superb wideout Roddy White, there was no one on the team who was a threat to score with every touch. Wide receiver Michael Jenkins is an average plugger who doesn't scare defenses. Harry Douglas showed zero burst after a knee surgery in 2009. And Tony Gonzalez is still Tony Gonzalez but dropped to 9.4 yards per catch, the first time in his 14-year career he wasn't in double digits. Meanwhile, Jerious Norwood, who the Falcons have wanted to be a home run hitter out of the backfield, cannot stay healthy. The word to sum up his career has changed from \"unlucky\" to \"brittle.\" He likely won't be in Falcons's plans for 2011. Finding a Norwood-type runner probably won't take precedence over obtaining another wide receiver, but it should. Thanks to Matt Ryan's efficiency, the passing game was just fine, ranking eighth in the NFL in the Football Outsiders DVOA ratings. The running game, usually credited with Falcons's success, was 27th in DVOA. Michael Turner and Jason Snelling were good for tough yards, but neither was a breakaway threat. Falcons was 28th in the NFL in second-level yards, a steep drop from their eighth-place finish in Adjusted Line Yards. That means more due should be given to the Falcons' offensive front than the backs, who were unable to turn five-yard gains into 25-yard gains.

Prior to this, the idea of trying to understand how the human body deteriorates during middle age wasn't really necessary. When someone reached their 30th birthday, it was pretty much understood that they weren't going to be around much longer. Even though advances in health care in the mid 1800s and early 1900s kept people alive a lot longer, it quickly became clear that people simply aren't as physically capable in their 30s as they are in their 20s. As evident as that fact was back then, one would think it would be even clearer today given the volume of physiological studies that have been done, showing specifically why and when the human body ages as it does. Too much history, I know. But that level of understanding certainly doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to Larry Fitzgerald and quarterbacks. The Cardinals' brain trust reportedly asked Larry Fitzgerald for his opinion as to which quarterback they should trade for or sign this offseason. Sources indicated Larry Fitzgerald gave them two names: Kevin Kolb and Marc Bulger. The Kevin Kolb suggestion is a strong one. He will be only 27 years old heading into the 2011 season and has the rough equivalent of only about half of one season's worth of wear and tear on his frame. The price to acquire him could be high, but at least the Cardinals would know that they would have a quarterback capable of giving them at least four -- and possibly as many as six to eight -- seasons worth of good starts. As commendable as the Kevin Kolb recommendation is, the idea of signing Bulger is just the opposite.

Tice, who was denied permission to interview for the Titans offensive coordinator position, had an extra year tacked on his deal and is now under contract with the Bears through the 2012 season. Tice, a 15-year NFL coaching veteran, arrived in Bears prior to the 2010 offseason after spending four seasons (2006-09) in Jaguars where he coached tight ends and had the title of assistant head coach. Although the Bears' offensive line surrendered 56 regular-season sacks, the team ran the ball effectively after the midway point of the year. With changes expected to occur on the offensive line heading into the 2011 season, Tice's presence on the coaching staff is considered a vital element to the teams' overall success moving forward. Spencer and Hoke have been Bears assistants since Lovie Smith took over as head coach in 2004. Under Spencer, the Bears have had a 1,000 yard rusher in four of the past seven years -- Thomas Jones '05,'06 and Matt Forte '08,'10. Babich was promoted to defensive coordinator following the Bears' Super Bowl appearance in 2006, but returned to solely coaching linebackers the past two years.

As a non-exclusive franchise player, Tamba Hali is guaranteed a one-year contract equal to the average paid last year to the five highest-paid players at his position if he stays with Chiefs. He can still negotiate with other teams. But the Chiefs would get two first-round draft picks from any team that signed him. After he was drafted out of Penn State in 2006, Tamba Hali was put at defensive end opposite Jared Allen. But he proved undersized at 265 pounds and was moved in 2009 to outside linebacker. There, he blossomed. His pass-rushing abilities helped the Chiefs make a franchise-record six-game improvement to 10-6 and win their first AFC West title since 2003. In addition to his 14\u00bd sacks, Tamba Hali had 50 tackles, 19 quarterback pressures and four forced fumbles. \"Tamba is a key contributor to our football team, and we have a tremendous amount of respect for him both personally and professionally,\" general manager Scott Pioli said. \"We want Tamba to remain a member of the Chiefs, and we will continue to work together with the hope of reaching a long-term agreement.\" An affable, outgoing man, Tamba Hali is one of the Chiefs' most popular players. He is a native of Liberia and lived in constant danger in the war-torn country as a youngster before moving to New Jersey with his father. In 2006, he was excused from training camp to fly back to New Jersey and be sworn in as a citizen of the United States.

Bears defensive end Julius Peppers makes an average of $14 million a year and while Richard Seymour's exact numbers will not be known until he signs, the numbers will come in north of Julius Peppers'. SI.com first reported Richard Seymour's extension. The website said Richard Seymour's contract is potentially worth $30 million and contains $22.5 million guaranteed. The 31-year-old defensive end went to the Pro Bowl last season, making a big impact in his second season in Raiders after being acquired in a trade from Patriots. He had 5\u00bd sacks and provided leadership for a young defense that features two rookies starting in the front seven. The Patriots own the Raiders' first-round pick (17th overall) in the 2011 draft as a result of the Richard Seymour trade. The deal allows Raiders to avoid using a franchise tag on Richard Seymour for a second straight season. He got about $12.4 million last season and would have been in line for a salary of about $14.9 million next season with the tag. Instead he signed a deal that will keep him in Raiders for two more seasons. \"It's a great place to play,\" he said last December. \"The fans are unlike any others in the league. They're definitely committed, and they want the same type players to play in this organization. The history of being here, the mystique of putting that silver and black on and representing the Raiders, it's been a lifelong dream for me and, hopefully, it continues.\" The Raiders' deal to acquire Richard Seymour was questioned by some because Raiders's picks recently have been so high in the draft. With the Raiders having their best season since 2002, the Patriots will pick 17th overall in April's draft. \"You may not think it was a good trade,\" Davis said last month. \"I thought it was a great trade. Still do.\" Richard Seymour was selected to his sixth Pro Bowl last season, anchoring Raiders's defense after moving inside to defensive tackle. Richard Seymour was praised by coaches and teammates for his play as well as his leadership on a youthful unit. Richard Seymour, 31, is a three-time Super Bowl winner with the Patriots and has 48.5 career sacks. The Raiders have historically done a good job keeping potential free agents whom they didn't want to test the free agent market. They signed long-term deals in recent years with cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, punter Shane Lechler and kicker Sebastian Janikowski instead of using franchise tags. The final year of Nnamdi Asomugha's $45.3 million, three-year contract voided earlier this offseason when he did not reach certain incentives, making him one of the many key potential free agents for the Raiders. The Raiders can't use the franchise tag on Nnamdi Asomugha, making tight end Zach Miller the most likely recipient if the team opts to use the tag. Zach Miller has led the Raiders in receiving for each of the past three seasons. He had 60 catches for 685 yards and five touchdowns last season. Among Raiders's other key potential free agents are offensive lineman Robert Gallery, running back Michael Bush, safety Michael Huff, cornerback Stanford Routt and defensive lineman John Henderson.

In a series of tweets Thursday, the Broncos chief of football operations said the team is engaged in constructive conversations with Champ Bailey's representatives about keeping the 32-year-old star in orange and blue. The Broncos are not planning to use their franchise tag on Champ Bailey because that would cost them about $15 million in guaranteed salary next season. If they don't sign him to a new deal, Champ Bailey would become an unrestricted free agent when a new collective bargaining agreement is hashed out. Champ Bailey just completed his seven-year, $63 million contract with a 10th Pro Bowl berth, a record for cornerbacks. New coach John Fox's massive makeover of Broncos's deficient defense would be much easier with Champ Bailey as the cornerstone. But Champ Bailey is putting his Littleton home up for sale, which could be a sign that he'd rather join a team that's closer to contending for a championship. \"We've been working with Champ Bailey's representative this week on a new contract, which is an important priority for us,\" Elway wrote on Twitter. \"Our conversations have been constructive, and we'll continue those talks in the hopes that we can reach an agreement. Champ's an elite player who means a great deal to our entire organization and our fans. We want Champ to finish his Hall of Fame career as a Broncos Bronco.\" The Broncos may already have blown that chance, however. Champ Bailey was close to signing a four-year extension for more than $40 million in October when the Broncos suddenly pulled the offer, concerned about his age and the league's labor uncertainty. That means Champ Bailey, who's coming off one of his better seasons in Broncos, stands to become an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career. Champ Bailey joined the Broncos in 2004 when former coach Mike Shanahan traded running back Clinton Portis to the Redskins in a rare swap of blue chip talent. Despite Champ Bailey's presence, the Broncos have long been bad on defense as Mike Shanahan and then Josh McDaniels focused more on the offensive side and annually changed defensive coordinators, who had to deconstruct schemes and implement new philosophies. The Broncos ranked last in several defensive categories last season and John Fox's deep defensive roots are part of what made him an attractive replacement for Josh McDaniels. John Fox hired Saints secondary coach Dennis Allen as his defensive coordinator, the team's sixth in six seasons. Yet another switch in scheme and philosophy would go down easier with Champ Bailey on board, especially with talented second-year cornerback Perrish Cox's status uncertain as he faces a sexual assault case. \"Champ is an outstanding player and I'd love to have the opportunity to work with him,\" Dennis Allen told The Associated Press. \"I think he'll fit in the things that we're going to ask him to do and we'd love to have him back. At the end of the day, it's really a decision for management and him and his agent and hopefully they can all come to an agreement that both sides can live with.\" Champ Bailey has long maintained that he loves Broncos and would like to stay put but that winning is his top concern. He's been to the playoffs just three times in his dozen NFL seasons and has never made it to the Super Bowl. At the Pro Bowl last month, he said he listened to several players making sales pitches about joining their teams next season. Among those hoping to lure him was Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis. \"Several guys realized I was a free agent and said they'd love to play with me,\" Champ Bailey said. \"But they don't make the decisions. Hopefully teams will show interest and we can really get things going in a couple months.\" Champ Bailey also said at the time that he was buoyed by John Fox's hiring but noted player acquisitions were equally important for a team that has so many defensive needs. \"I think we're going in a good direction,\" Champ Bailey said. \"I don't think things can get worse. One thing I do know is Coach John Fox is a good defensive-minded coach and won a lot of games throughout his career, as both an assistant and head coach. I know he can do a good job for the Broncos.

Living in Seahawks is also to live with the daily shadow of 14,411-foot Mount Rainier almost blocking out the rest of the civilized world. As I was fast becoming the \"armchair\" climber in my dumb fantasy world of climbing books, it became apparent that if I wanted to experience any sort of actual high-altitude stuff myself \u2026 well, then, Mount Rainier would have to at least be an initial goal. High-altitude mountaineering may not be the most typical subject to read about here at ESPN.com. This time of the year is tough if you're a Sonics fan like me. The NBA has become a non-healing wound; like seeing that girlfriend who left you \u2026 constantly flashed across the ESPN TV screen. But of course, that is another story \u2026 and a dark one. I seem to look for identifiable heroes in the sports that I follow. The good ones take a piece of each one of us on their journeys. In 2007, The Discovery Channel started its first season of \"Everest: Beyond The Limit,\" a TV series following the real-life attempt of an 11-member team to summit Mount Everest. Being a mountain-climbing enthusiast, I naturally watched the show (I hadn't climbed anything yet). The person I could most identify with on the show was a guy named Tim Medvetz, a Harley-riding, tattooed misfit who had been through a bit of hell before Everest was even in his plans at all. Here is a quick list to encapsulate his adult life: 1. At 20, Tim flies to Brazil from his native New York. 2. Lives in a Rio slum. 3. Learns Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 4. Does a little time in a Brazilian jail. 5. Comes back to New York and works as a bouncer at rowdy nightclubs. 6. Comes to Los Angeles. 7. Joins the Hell's Angels. 8. Gets into a real bad motorcycle accident. 9. Wakes up in a hospital room on Sept. 11, 2001. 10. In a haze of confusion about his newly broken body, the two images he sees are his dangling right foot and the North Tower coming down on television. 11. A surgeon says Tim will lose his foot. 12. Tim says to surgeon \"I lose my foot, you lose your foot\" (see number 7 again). 13. Doctor tells Tim that his lower spine and right ankle will each be permanently fused. Says Tim will basically be an invalid. 14. Tim reads \"Into Thin Air\" in his hospital bed. 15. Tim decides to climb Mount Everest. 16. Tim goes to Thailand to study Muay Thai kickboxing and get his fitness back. He stays in a martial arts camp and scrapes by financially. 17. Tim goes to a Tibetan monastery to live, and climbs nearby mountains. 18. Tim climbs Mount Everest. 19. Tim meets me and at a fancy Hollywood party (well, of course, right?). 20. His life has become a never-ending game of \"dodge the goofball\" ever since number 19. 21. Tim sees a need for more of a safety net for disabled U.S. veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 22. Tim knows what it's like to be in a hospital bed and dealing with a life-changing prognosis. 23. Tim starts The Heroes Project, a nonprofit that aims to get wounded veterans up the highest summits on each continent. 24. He has gotten a different U.S. veteran up three so far; Denali (North America), Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa) and Mount Elbrus (Europe). 25. Bad-ass. 26. Period. Tim has now become a member of an elite club: the few who have climbed Everest. Since then, he has climbed many more big mountains all around the world. And yes, we really did become friends, and pretty good ones at that. Good enough friends that I felt comfortable asking Tim if I could start coming along on some of his training climbs in California (Angeles Crest, Baldy, Alta Peak). He is helping me learn the ropes up there on those slippery and steep ledges. Tim is the tortoise and I am the hare going up those arduous inclines. Tim always says I am in too big of a rush. I tell him to hurry up \u2026 I've got places to go and people to see. Tim only trudges forward, and at his own pace. He seems to know stuff about things I do not up there. I just want to get to the summit. Those crampons are a pain in the butt, and my pack has too much crap in it. It starts to slow me down. Tim catches up, and tells me again that I am in too much of a damn rush. He pushes my pack, and I skid back down the mountain about 150 yards. \"Who's in the lead now?\" he laughs. That forces me to slow down, I guess. It was when we finally got to the summit of 11,400-foot Alta Peak that I realized the full scope of Tim's tenacious immersion in his sport and how he has translated it all into the avenue of helping our wounded vets. It's not about a trip from A to B with Tim; it is all of the stuff in between. Tim is a high-altitude athlete of the highest order. He trains as hard -- and probably harder -- than most pro athletes out there. But for me, as a fan of sports, he is the guy I want to most emulate. His values, as far as walking it likes he talks it, are ridiculous. While many may pay lip service to a cause like \"supporting our troops,\" Tim has gone the extra mile and actually taken action. I'm not trying to pimp my own band here -- my editor asked me to include this part -- but Tim's story did inspire Loaded's new song \"Fight On.\" The proceeds from the iTunes download go to the VA Puget Sound Hospital. We played the song at halftime of a Seahawks game last season on Veterans Appreciation Day. All of this because of my pal, Tim Medvetz.

With the current labor deal expiring March 3 and a chance of a lockout after that, there has been little action regarding possible free agents beyond teams using their franchise tag designation. But the Raiders and Richard Seymour went ahead with the deal that includes $22.5 million in guaranteed money for the defensive tackle and allows the team to save the franchise tag designation for another player. \"I'm thrilled to be with the Silver and Black, a team that has a bright future,\" Richard Seymour said in a statement. \"As I mentioned many times before, I see myself retiring a Raider.\" The Raiders gave Patriots a 2011 first-round pick for Richard Seymour before the 2009 season and owner Al Davis made it a priority to keep Richard Seymour. Richard Seymour got about $12.4 million last season as an exclusive franchise player and would have been in line for a salary of about $14.9 million next season if he had been tagged again. Patriots will get the 17th pick in April's draft as compensation for Richard Seymour after the Raiders finished 8-8 for their first non-losing season since 2002. \"This is a positive for the Raiders and his re-signing was something that the organization knew would be in play when making the move several years ago,\" coach Hue Jackson said. \"Richard is an important part of our team and he continues to be highly productive and a major contributor both on and off the field.\" Richard Seymour was selected to his sixth Pro Bowl last season, recording 5\u00bd sacks and anchoring Raiders's defense after moving inside to defensive tackle. Richard Seymour was praised by coaches and teammates for his play as well as his leadership on a unit that included two rookies in the front seven. Richard Seymour, 31, is a three-time Super Bowl winner with the Patriots and has 48.5 career sacks. The Raiders also will be able to keep linebacker Kamerion Wimbley before he is eligible for free agency if they choose. Kamerion Wimbley's agent, Joe Linta, confirmed a report by Fox Sports that the Raiders can exercise a buyback worth approximately $3.5 million to keep Kamerion Wimbley under contract for 2011 instead of becoming a free agent. Linta said the Raiders have not notified him of their plans but he expects them to do so before a March 3 deadline. Kamerion Wimbley led Raiders with nine sacks last season after coming over from Browns in a trade for a third-round pick. Among the other key potential free agents for Raiders are Pro Bowl cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, offensive lineman Robert Gallery, running back Michael Bush, safety Michael Huff, cornerback Stanford Routt and defensive lineman John Henderson. With Richard Seymour locked up, the Raiders can use the franchise tag on anyone other than Nnamdi Asomugha, who is unable to be franchised under the terms of his expiring deal. The most likely candidates would probably be Miller or Robert Gallery. Miller has led the Raiders in receiving for each of the past three seasons. He had 60 catches for 685 yards and five touchdowns last season and would be paid about $7.3 million as the franchise player. Robert Gallery has been perhaps Raiders's most reliable offensive lineman since moving to guard in 2007. He would be projected to get in excess of $10 million as the franchise player.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6133103", "Entities": ["Richard Seymour", "Raiders", "Patriots", "Hue Jackson", "Kamerion Wimbley", "Browns", "Nnamdi Asomugha", "Robert Gallery", "Michael Bush", "Michael Huff", "Stanford Routt"]}, {"title": "LA panel won't be tainted", "author": null, "date": "Feb 17, 2011", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- The co-chairman of a commission appointed by the mayor to analyze plans for a downtown Los Angeles NFL stadium defended the panel's independence Thursday in light of members' ties to the developer of the proposed venue. Deputy mayor and economic policy chief Austen Beutner said after the commission's first meeting that all of the business and civic leaders on the panel are committed to doing what's right for city residents. \"Just because they've known someone in the past, I don't think prejudices them in any way shape or form,\" said Beutner, who also noted that sports and entertainment company AEG played no role in selecting committee members. The Associated Press reported last week that most members of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's commission on the proposed stadium had financial, political or civic ties with AEG, although Beutner was not among them. AEG's plan calls for the city to issue up to $350 million in bonds to relocate a huge convention center structure where the 64,000-seat stadium would be built. The company has promised to service that debt and pay any shortfalls. City officials must also approve AEG's lease for space on the city-owned convention center property. AEG has also said it will pick up the entire $1 billion tab for the stadium itself. Beutner said the commission, which includes former Gov. Gray Davis, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman and CEO Michael Lynton, and Colony Capital LLC principal Richard Nanula, would not endorse a plan that didn't provide a net gain to the city. \"This has the potential to be transformative,\" he said. \"But we need to do it right and our charge is to make sure it's done right.\" AEG's plan is one of two competing proposals that aim to bring football back to Los Angeles more than 15 years after the Rams and Raiders left the huge market. Warehouse magnate Ed Roski has permits in place to build a 75,000-seat stadium about 15 miles east of Los Angeles in the city of Industry. Both camps have said they hope to recruit a team -- and possibly two -- from among those in the league that need a new stadium to maximize revenue but are unable to get one built in their current locations.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nfl/news/story?id=6133607", "Entities": ["Rams", "Raiders"]}, {"title": "Rob Ryan eager to mold Cowboys' D", "author": "Tim MacMahon", "date": "Feb 18, 2011", "content": "IRVING, Texas -- New Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan's goal for his first meeting with the Valley Ranch media was to be \"humble and boring.\" But Ryan, the brash son of longtime NFL coach Buddy and twin brother of Jets coach Rex, couldn't help himself. He vowed -- and swore -- that a team that allowed the second-most points in the league last season (27.3 per game) would feature a dominant defense again. \"The problems and all that? Hey, I'm not here to farm anybody else's land,\" Ryan said. \"I'm going to do a great [expletive] job and you're going to see that.\" After a brief pause, Ryan smirked and offered a half-hearted apology for the profanity. \"Sorry. Only one so far,\" said Ryan, who saw humor in his father's hatred of the Cowboys during Buddy's days as the head coach of the Eagles and Cardinals. \"I was guarded early, but hell, that's on me.\" It's also on Ryan to turn around a defense that deteriorated drastically last season. The Cowboys went from the number 2 scoring defense in the NFL in 2009 to number 31 in 2010, costing former head coach/defensive coordinator Wade Phillips his job in the process. But Ryan, who was hired by Jason Garrett after getting let go following a coaching change in Browns, prefers to focus on the positive. \"To be honest with you, I haven't seen talent like this on a defense in a long time,\" Ryan said. \"I'm awfully anxious to get going with them.\" Ryan didn't only praise the talent he'll inherit on the Cowboys defense, which is headlined by perennial Pro Bowl outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware. He repeatedly referred to himself as \"a damn good football coach\" and proclaimed that his assistant coaches, including two he brought with him from the Browns, are even better. And he promised that his defense would have immediate success after implementing his 3-4 system, which disguises coverages and fronts more than Wade Phillips' scheme. \"We're not going to have to make any excuses,\" said Ryan, whose unit in Browns ranked 13th in the NFL in scoring defense last season, allowing 20.8 points per game. \"We're going to win.\" Ryan made it clear that he didn't anticipate a change of position with nose tackle Jay Ratliff in his system. There had been speculation that Jay Ratliff, considered undersized for a 3-4 nose tackle at about 300 pounds, might move to defensive end. Ryan quickly shot down that idea. \"He's a great player,\" Ryan said of Jay Ratliff. \"Our system can find a spot for any great player. He's going to do just fine over the football.\" Ryan, however, seems to have little doubt that Jay Ratliff will wreak havoc in opposing backfields again. \"He's an excellent player,\" Ryan said. \"I can't wait to get to work with him. I already met him and what an encouraging thing that is, because if they're all like him, we're going to be in great shape.\" Ryan, who won two Super Bowl rings as the Patriots' linebackers coach last decade, said it's been a long time since he's seen a defense with more talent than the Cowboys'. That, combined with his vast self-confidence, made Ryan comfortable making bold predictions. \"We're going to be a great defense,\" Ryan said. \"If I never said that, if I didn't believe that, then you've got the wrong guy.

The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, an independent U.S. government agency, will oversee negotiations in Redskins beginning Friday. \"Any time that both sides of negotiations can get together, whether through conventional means of bargaining or mediation, to come to an agreement that can benefit all parties, it is a good thing,\" NFLPA president Kevin Mawae told The Associated Press in an e-mail. Friday will be the first of seven straight scheduled days of negotiations between the league and the players' union. Meanwhile, the union is seeking to make public details from negotiations between the NFL and television networks that resulted in a deal that pays the owners $4 billion, regardless of whether games are played in 2011, the St. Paul Pioneer Press has reported. A federal judge in Minneapolis will hear arguments Thursday morning on a union appeal over a ruling that allows the league to retain the rights fees, according to the newspaper. Attorneys for the NFLPA also have asked Judge David S. Doty to unseal 34 pages of case documents beforehand. Arbitrator Stephen Burbank rejected a union complaint last month that alleged the NFL structured the contracts so it would be guaranteed money even if there were a lockout in 2011 -- while not maximizing revenue from other seasons, when the league would have to share that income with players. The union said that violated a 17-year-old agreement between the sides that stipulates the league must make good-faith efforts to maximize revenue for players. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to meet twice a week two weeks ago, yet have met only once since. \"Personally, I would be surprised if they met more than two or three days in a row,\" one source familiar with the talks told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. FMCS director George H. Cohen can make suggestions and recommendations, but he has no authority to impose settlements. Coming to an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement still will be up to the two parties. \"Our agency director will be working with the parties to assist them in reaching a voluntary, mutually acceptable agreement,\" FMCS public affairs director John Arnold said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. After holding separate discussions with representatives from the league and the union, Cohen said both sides accepted an invitation from his agency to get involved in the stalled negotiations. \"Due to the extreme sensitivity of these negotiations and consistent with the FMCS's long-standing practice, the agency will refrain from any public comment concerning the future schedule and/or the status of those negotiations until further notice,\" Cohen said. The collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players expires at 11:59 p.m. ET March 3. Last week, talks broke down, leading to the cancellation of one planned session. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told the AP in an e-mail: \"We are now in mediation.\" The league also switched an owners meeting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on March 3, to Chantilly, Va., March 2-3. In a statement, NFLPA spokesman George Atallah said: \"The NFLPA has always focused on a fair collective bargaining agreement through negotiations. We hope that this renewed effort, through mediation, will help the players and owners reach a successful deal.\" Colts center Jeff Saturday, an executive board member of the NFLPA, told ESPN's \"NFL Live\" on Thursday that he was \"excited\" about the prospect of entering mediation. \"It can do nothing but help,\" Jeff Saturday said. The biggest issue separating the owners and players is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Under the old deal, the owners receive $1 billion off the top, and they want to increase that to $2 billion before players get their share. Among the other significant points in negotiations: the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; a rookie wage scale; and benefits for retired players. The NFL and union went more than two months without holding any formal bargaining sessions, until a meeting Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The NFL filed an unfair labor practice charge against its players' union with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. The league's filing said the union \"consistently has failed to confer in good faith\" during negotiations for a new contract and the union's \"conduct amounts to surface bargaining and an anticipatory refusal to bargain.\" Aiello told the AP the mediation would not have an effect on the NLRB complaint. Colts owner Jim Irsay recalled the last CBA negotiations in 2006, which resulted in a deal that the owners opted out of in 2008. \"Since the last time, things have broken off and guys have gone their separate ways,\" Irsay said Thursday. \"I remember that happened the last time and [then-commissioner] Paul Tagliabue ended up texting [union chief] Gene Upshaw and said,'Why don't we get back together.' So you never know when something positive can happen and something good can get done. \"I don't have a strong anticipation something will get done before [March 3], but I think it's possible.\" Player sources told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen that last week's talks ended after owners walked away from the negotiating table when the NFLPA proposed to take an average of 50 percent of all revenue generated by the league. However, other sources familiar with the talks told Mortensen and Schefter that the negotiations broke off when the union characterized its documents as an \"illustration\" that NFL officials believed represented a proposal for revenue sharing between owners and players. The FMCS website says it \"provides free mediation services in contract negotiation disputes between employers and their unionized employees. All the parties have to do is make a request.\" Cohen, who said in a statement that the negotiations will be conducted \"under my auspices,\" is no stranger to sports mediation. He was involved in Major League Soccer's talks with its players' union and a work stoppage was avoided last year. Cohen also has worked with the players' associations for Major League Baseball and the NBA, and was an adviser to the NHL players' union before joining the FMCS. The FMCS also became involved in negotiations during the 2004-05 NHL lockout, and a 2005 dispute between the U.S. Soccer Federation and its players. \"Our ultimate goal is a new CBA,\" Atallah wrote Thursday on his Twitter feed. \"I will not discuss any details about the next set of negotiations. We are observing a strict media blackout.\" Some players, however, were commenting moments after the announcement. \"NFL and NFLPA agreeing to meet with a federal mediator is a real positive step,\" Vikings tackle Bryant McKinnie said on his Twitter account. \"Let's see if he can get them to make actual progress.\" Added player agent Drew Rosenhaus: \"Exciting news to see the NFLPA & the Owners talking again through the mediation process -- a productive step in the right direction!\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6132690", "Entities": ["Redskins", "Colts", "Jeff Saturday", "Vikings", "Bryant McKinnie"]}, {"title": "Plugging the Holes: NFC North", "author": null, "date": "Feb 18, 2011", "content": "Last Wednesday, Football Outsiders began its Plugging the Holes series, in which it targets the offseason issues facing each team in the NFL by division. Mike Tanier finishes with the NFC North. In this edition, Outsiders looks at the Bears' offensive line problems, the Lions' strong finish, the Packers' roster and the chances the Vikings have to rebuild. The Bears gave up 56 sacks in 2010, and only a small portion of the blame can be placed on Mike Martz's pass-happy offense. Martz reined in his scheme a lot, using tight ends as extra blockers and running the ball more often in the second half of the season, but the Bears lacked talent on the line, and their preseason personnel-juggling made matters worse. With so many other pieces in place, the Bears' road to the Super Bowl looks clear: fix the offensive line, and everything else fixes itself. The Bears made their first important move of the offseason when they retained offensive line coach Mike Tice, who was coveted as an offensive coordinator by the Titans. Tice took some heat for installing overcomplicated blocking schemes at the start of the season, but he made adjustments and improvements as the season went on, and the last thing the Bears' line needed during the offseason was a shake-up of continuity. No one position on the Bears' line should be considered \"set,\" not even center. Olin Kreutz is 34, a free agent and coming off a terrible year by his standards. Roberto Garza is 32 and flipped from left to right guard last year. Former first-round pick Chris Williams slid from left tackle to guard, a major demotion for a team in need of good tackles. Frank Omiyale moved from right to left tackle out of necessity, and J'Marcus Webb was overmatched at right tackle.

It's over, and we'll move on.\" Buehrle and his wife Jamie are huge advocates for animal rights, particularly with dogs. An avid hunter, Buehrle was asked the difference between dogfighting and the activity he enjoys. \"Hunting is a sport,\" he said. \"There are hunting stores out there.

It is my business in the sense that he is a Bears White Sox player, but it was the offseason, and he's his own man. \"He's got some very strong opinions about animal rights, and I support those. I wish that it would have been handled differently, but it wasn't and that's as much as I'm going to say on it.

Team owner Jim Irsay released the 2007 NFL defensive player of the year Friday, announcing the decision less than 24 hours after he told reporters he would make a decision about Sanders' future before March 3. \"We thank Bob for all his incredible contributions, from his Super Bowl interception to his defensive player of the year honor,\" Irsay said in a statement. The move was not a major surprise. After winning the league's top defensive honor, Sanders signed a five-year, $37.5 million contract but played in only nine regular-season games the next three seasons. With safety Antoine Bethea signing a four-year, $27 million contract last summer; Melvin Bullitt, Sanders' backup, emerging as a competent starter; and the Colts still trying to sign four-time league MVP Peyton Manning to a new long-term deal, there wasn't enough room to keep Sanders. The Colts gave Peyton Manning the exclusive franchise tag Tuesday, a move that would pay Peyton Manning about $23 million next season if he plays under the tag. Given those constraints, Colts could no longer afford Sanders -- and everyone knew it. Last month, Sanders' agent, Tom Condon, told The Associated Press he \"anticipated the same thing you do\" when asked whether the Colts inquired about redoing Sanders' contract or letting him hit the free-agent market. A message left for Condon Friday was not immediately returned. \"I want to thank Mr. Irsay for the opportunity to play with the Colts,\" Sanders said in a statement released by the team. \"I appreciate all he and the organization did for me throughout my career, and I always will consider myself a Colt. I want to thank the fans also for their great support. They played a big part in making my seven years with the team very rewarding.\" When Sanders was healthy, he was one of the league's top defenders. He played in 14 games in 2005, helping the Colts go 13-0 and earning the first of two Pro Bowl selections. A knee injury limited him to only four regular-season games in 2006, but when he returned for the playoffs, the Colts' run defense improved dramatically and was a key reason they won the Super Bowl. Sanders was healthy again in 2007, playing in 15 games, earning another Pro Bowl trip and becoming the first Colts player to win the league's top defensive award. But even Sanders acknowledged his reckless style likely would shorten his NFL career, and some fans even wanted the Colts to keep Sanders on the bench until the playoffs started. There was a reason for all of it. Injuries limited Sanders to only six regular-season games in 2008. He missed the first five games in 2009 following knee surgery, then in his second game back, tore the biceps in his left arm and missed the rest of the season. Sanders didn't even make it through that many games last year. He tore his right biceps on the first defensive series of the season opener and did not play again. That left Sanders' future with the Colts in jeopardy. \"Before March 3, I think we'll probably have some sense on that direction,\" Irsay said Thursday when asked about Sanders. \"Again, there's nothing definitive. We've talked through a lot of different scenarios, I can't say definitively what direction we're going there.\" On Friday, Irsay made it official. Sanders had 373 tackles, 3\u00bd sacks, two forced fumbles, three recoveries and six interceptions in seven NFL seasons.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6135553", "Entities": ["Colts", "Antoine Bethea", "Peyton Manning"]}, {"title": "NFL penalizes Lions for tampering", "author": null, "date": "Feb 18, 2011", "content": "DETROIT -- The NFL says the Lions have violated the league's policy against tampering and ruled they must forfeit their upcoming seventh-round draft pick and exchange fifth-round picks with the Chiefs.

He made no apologies for what he believes this Cowboys defense can be. \"They look excellent,\" Ryan said. \"The problems and all that? Hey, I'm not here to farm anybody else's land. I'm going to do a great [expletive] job, and you're going to see that.\" This is a unit that allowed a franchise-worst 436 points last season -- including 126 in the fourth quarter, the third-most in the league -- and ranked 23rd in total defense. And after allowing 43 plays of 20 yards or more in 2009, the Cowboys saw that number skyrocket to 69 in 2010, the sixth-worst mark in the NFL. Despite those failures, people around the league will tell you the Cowboys have some of the most talented defensive players in the NFL. The first name that comes to mind is ever-improving outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, whom Ryan plans to move all over the field to disrupt the quarterback. Then there is underachieving outside linebacker Anthony Spencer. Ryan seemed to take offense when the word \"regressed\" was used to describe his game last year. \"Damn, that Anthony Spencer regressed, huh?\" Ryan said. \"I think he's going to be outstanding, I really do. If he got worse, I can't wait to see him better, because I really like the way this guy works.\" The two starting inside linebackers, Bradie James and Keith Brooking, will be in their 30s when -- and if -- the 2011 season starts. Both are coming off nagging injuries that curtailed their practice time and perhaps affected their level of play. Ryan said he's spoken to both and feels they can still perform at an elite level, and he believes linebackers coach Matt Eberflus, his right-hand man for the defense, will elevate their games as well. We can also talk about the defensive line and whether it needs fixing. Pro Bowl nose tackle Jay Ratliff struggled at times when faced with double-teams, but Ryan and new defensive line coach Brian Baker have no plans to move him to an end position. Jay Ratliff, considered by some to be undersized for his position, has already spoken to both men and is excited about making strides to improve his game. The secondary was one of last season's biggest disappointments. Terence Newman and Mike Jenkins were both honored as Pro Bowlers in 2009, but they struggled mightily in 2010. Owner/GM Jerry Jones, the man who signs the checks around here, said he expects Terence Newman and Mike Jenkins to return to a Pro Bowl level in 2011. Ryan expects the same and believes that using multiple coverages along with a dangerous pass rush should take pressure off the two starting cornerbacks. \"We want them to be great,\" said Ryan, who added that he thinks secondary coaches Dave Campo and Brett Maxie will fix the safeties and corners once they learn Ryan's system. \"They have to be cover guys first in our system and they have to be accurate tacklers, so anything other than that is not us. We have to get tremendous players out there on the corner and be able to shut down wide receivers and again be accurate tacklers. There's no place in football for a coward, and it's definitely not going to be for a corner for us. It's a marquee position and that's what it is here in the NFL.\" It seemed Thursday afternoon that the new defensive coordinator is pretty happy with his unit's outlook for 2011. He isn't here to just sit back and relax. He wants his defense to take on an aggressive personality, a personality that creates turnovers -- something coach Jason Garrett wants -- and gets opposing offenses off the field and wins games. It's the type of swagger this defense needs. It's the swagger that Buddy's kid has brought to Cowboys after 14 years of NFL experience in other places. \"Well, I've had success, even though it's been documented that I haven't,\" Ryan said. \"I know I'm great, but I know my assistant coaches and the guys that I'm with are better than me. That's why I have a lot of faith in them and a lot of faith in this talent here.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/columns/story?columnist=watkins_calvin&id=6133380", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "DeMarcus Ware", "Anthony Spencer", "Bradie James", "Keith Brooking", "Jay Ratliff", "Terence Newman", "Mike Jenkins", "Jason Garrett"]}, {"title": "Report: Lions agree with Erik Coleman", "author": null, "date": "Feb 18, 2011", "content": "DETROIT -- A person familiar with the deal tells The Associated Press safety Erik Coleman and the Lions have agreed to a contract.

Friday's session was the sides' first with George Cohen, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a U.S. government agency. More than two hours after Goodell and Smith arrived separately, the league and the NFL Players Association released a joint statement saying the mediation had started and that both parties agreed to adhere to Cohen's request that they not speak publicly about the process. True to their word, Smith and other union representatives -- including Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch, former player Pete Kendall and NFLPA lawyer Richard Berthelsen -- declined to answer questions on their way out of the meeting. \"There's not going to be any comment,\" Smith said as he walked out at 6:15 p.m., more than seven hours after he arrived. Goodell and other members of the NFL's bargaining team -- including the league's lead labor negotiator, Jeff Pash, and NFL outside counsel Bob Batterman -- avoided media members in front of the building entirely. They left via another exit, an FMCS spokesman said. It wasn't immediately clear when the sides would resume talks, although originally there were plans for several days of negotiations with Cohen present. Pash did speak briefly when he and other NFL executives showed up Friday morning. \"We're going to participate fully, and we look forward to working with Mr. Cohen,\" he told The Associated Press. Asked what progress he expected to come from mediation, Pash replied: \"We don't know.\" Cohen announced Thursday that both sides had agreed to have him participate in talks. Mediation is not binding. The current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the day March 3, and the union has said it expects a lockout to come as soon as the next day. Meanwhile, the union is seeking to make public details from negotiations between the NFL and television networks that resulted in a deal that pays the owners $4 billion, regardless of whether games are played in 2011, the St. Paul Pioneer Press has reported. A federal judge in Minneapolis will hear arguments Thursday morning on a union appeal over a ruling that allows the league to retain the rights fees, according to the newspaper. Attorneys for the NFLPA also have asked Judge David S. Doty to unseal 34 pages of case documents before next week's hearing. Arbitrator Stephen Burbank rejected a union complaint last month that alleged the NFL structured the contracts so it would be guaranteed money even if there were a lockout in 2011 -- while not maximizing revenue from other seasons, when the league would have to share that income with players. The union said that violated a 17-year-old agreement between the sides that stipulates the league must make good-faith efforts to maximize revenue for players. The current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the day March 3, and the union has said it expects a lockout to come as soon as the next day. News of the start of mediation could be a positive sign after several months of infrequent negotiations. The league and union went more than two months without holding any formal bargaining sessions, until a meeting Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once last week but called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Among the other significant points in negotiations: the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; a rookie wage scale; and benefits for retired players. Cohen was involved in Major League Soccer's negotiations with its players' union last year, when a possible work stoppage was avoided. He was the baseball players' association's lead lawyer in federal court in 1995, when the National Labor Relations Board obtained an injunction against owners from then-District Judge -- and now Supreme Court Justice -- Sonia Sotomayor that led players to end their 7\u00bd-month strike.

I mean, besides the looming end to the collective bargaining agreement, the prospect of a work stoppage or lockout, questions about the validity of franchise and transition tags, the prospect of limited or no free agency, a crippled trade market, and the possibility of an expanded regular season? Yeah, I'm tired of all that noise, too. It's gonna be a long, cold summer. And unfortunately, player movement is likely to be limited for a while, so we'll have a hard time knowing who'll be playing where. But that's OK. That's why you don't draft in February. But I do. Hey, we do the best with what we've got, right? So until they tell us that players are allowed to sign with new teams, we'll just have to read the tea leaves. After all, it shouldn't stop us from speculating, for example, about what the Panthers are going to do with their backfield, or how the Cowboys might juggle their young weapons, right? And then there are the rookies. Until April, we won't know where they'll play (and we won't know which veterans will feel heat as a result), but we sure should start learning their names. So here's my 2011 One-Man Mock 1.0, where I start to make sense of all these variables. I've provided some commentary where a selection might conflict with the ranks I released six weeks ago; forty-odd days of news has already made those early-January thoughts seem a little stale. I've also indicated players who are technically free agents as of today, while not including those who've been franchise or transition tagged on that list. Let's go! I had Maurice James Jones-Drew number 3 among running backs five weeks ago, and regular readers know I love the guy. But news about his knee is sketchy at best; he at least had meniscus surgery, and it's possible the procedure was more serious than that. We've got six months of hand-wringing to do about MJD, so he's either a great bargain at number 5 or a time bomb. Where is the Aaron Rodgers tipping point? I guess for me right now it's at number 7. I think Ray Rice will be undervalued after his \"disappointing\"'10 season. (Can a very patriotic 1,776 total yards qualify as disappointing?) After him? I know the principles of VBD tell us even the top quarterbacks don't distance themselves enough from their positional cohorts to dominate fantasy. But there's something to be said for safety, and the Super Bowl MVP has been almost perfectly safe the past two seasons. Of course, take him this early, and the \"almost\" will haunt you: those concussions from'10 were more than just a mere speed bump. It's often quite fashionable for Team 10 to go WR-WR with its first two picks, and certainly there's no shortage of great receivers available. Of course, in'10, that might've netted you Randy Santana Moss and Larry Fitzgerald. Ga. In this draft, Team 10 is quite pleased with Frank Gore and Rashard Mendenhall. If there's one guy I've reassessed most since my first pass, it's Michael Turner. Quick: who's older, Michael Turner or Frank Gore? Ryan Granted, Frank Gore has 1,641 career NFL touches to Michael Turner's 1,150, but Michael Turner is 15 months older. This week, I went back and watched every carry Michael Turner had from the Falcons' five final regular-season games, and the difference in his legs was remarkable. He still got in the end zone a bunch, but there was rarely a threat of him breaking anything big; after notching seven carries of 20-plus yards in his first 11 games, he had one in those final five. Maybe he was hurt. But I'm beginning to think it's going to be a mistake to take him in the first round next year. In my January ranks, I kept the Panthers backs in the same neighborhood, but the more I think about it, the more I think Panthers has to move on from DeAngelo Mike DeAngelo Williams, and hand their starting gig to Jonathan Stewart. He looked like a top-five rusher last December. Matt Forte doesn't thrill me, but late in the second is probably about right for him. Despite what the talking heads say, he's not a game-breaking threat. But he's also not a plodder; he'll make a big play when the defense plays dumb. The Bears have to figure out their O-line, but using Chester Taylor in short yardage didn't work. Not that it's a huge distinction, but I flip-flopped Tom Brady and Peyton Manning at my number 3 and 4 spots among quarterbacks, so Teams 1 and 2 followed suit. (Not bad for the owners of Adrian Peterson and Chris Johnson to boast Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, respectively.) Tom Brady won't be perfect again and Peyton Manning won't go through a career-worst stretch of 11 picks in three games again, but Indy has major questions to address on its offensive line. By the way, in many drafts, obviously, the top quarterbacks will go much earlier than this, but I don't think they should. Round 3 is the best place to grab one of the top-five signal callers; if you don't get one there, you wait. Team 4 gets Michael Vick in my third round; in many drafts, Michael Vick might be the number 1 player taken. Unfortunately, I think he gets hurt again. Yes, I'm making a stand on Jahvid Best. His talent is huge, and all indications are the Lions have no plans for a committee. I know his health is scary, but fortune favors the bold. I like the John Fox hiring for Knowshon Moreno. John Fox won't call the plays in Broncos, but as a defensive head coach in Panthers, he led a run-first attack. No question Tim Tebow could be a big-time annoyance if he wins the starting job under center, but Knowshon Moreno's value gets an uptick, and Team 6 likes pairing him with Ray Rice very much. Team 9 is glad to take a chance on Vincent Steven Vincent Jackson as its number 1 receiver; things have cleared up with the Chargers deciding to use their franchise tag on V-Jax Steven Vincent Jackson, clearing the way for what should be a full season of sweet music with Philip Rivers. It feels like I've fallen a little out of love with Reggie Wayne, one of my perennial favorites and someone of whom I've always been a staunch defender. Ho hum, he just posted yet another top-10 fantasy season in'10, but his deep speed is (pardon the pun) waning. Team 10 is thrilled to have him here, but for the first time in memory Reggie Wayne feels like a third- or fourth-round draftee. Team 9 probably needs another receiver here, but can't stay away from Steven Vincent Jackson, who has fall-off-a-cliff potential, but who did just post the second-most carries in the NFL. If the Rams start scoring more with Josh McDaniels as coordinator, Steven Vincent Jackson could have one last happy go-round. Meanwhile, look at the next two picks. LeGarrette Blount couldn't have ended'10 any hotter, and Peyton Hillis finished fourth for the entire season among fantasy rushers. Of course, each guy has warts: LeGarrette Blount weighs 250 pounds (on a light day) and eventually seems like a committee natural, while Peyton Hillis wore down something fierce in December and has Montario Hardesty around. Each guy will probably go higher than this, and maybe that'll be a good thing. Maybe. Team 2 looks like a juggernaut; unfortunately, that juggernaut may be from'08. DeAngelo Mike DeAngelo Williams might need a new team, and hasn't been healthy much in two seasons. I watched Week 17's tape on Ryan Mathews and bumped him up a few spots, because once his ankle got right he looked like a new man. He'd be very risky as your number 2 fantasy rusher; then again, Team 1 has a pretty good number 1. Personally, I tend not to take a tight end as early as the fifth round, and last year's bloodbath at the position showed you why. But Teams 1 and 2 are sitting there knowing there's pretty good receiver depth and they don't pick again for 20-odd slots. So they stake a claim on the two elites, and let everyone else fight for scraps. I feel strongly tempted to drop Kenny Britt out of my wideout top 15 because of his quarterback uncertainty, but I'm resisting the urge for now. His talent is so great, and just a minor upgrade over Kerry Collins would renew my faith in him. Santonio Holmes is a terrific get for Team 7, who can pair him with the man who replaced him in Steelers, Mike Wallace. Santonio Holmes was the straw that stirred the drink for the Jets last year and I have to believe if New York chooses between him and Braylon Edwards, Braylon Edwards is gone. Team 8 felt insecure about the relatively speculative backfield duo of Jonathan Stewart and LeGarrette Blount, but may have compounded the problem with BenJarvus A.J. Green-Ellis. Drafting a Patriots running back to be anywhere near my starting lineup puts a lump in my stomach. With expectations now thoroughly in check, Marques Colston can go back to being a valued fantasy commodity. If we don't view him as a number 1 receiver, he won't tick us off so much. After Teams 9 and 8 take quarterbacks, only Team 6 is left without one, and this after only 53 total selections. This is, I must say, absolutely not the way I tend to draft; I rarely feel compelled to take the seventh-, eighth- or ninth-best signal caller on my list, because they're just not appreciably better than the 10th or 11th. Maybe this year's an exception. Maybe there are \"nine guys\" at quarterback, with the risk/reward ratio growing unfavorable after Big Ben. Maybe. But for the rest of this draft, you can just call me \"Team 6.\" I'd say Shonn A.J. Greene and Ryan Mathews will make interesting test cases again this year. They were my poster children for too much hype last summer, and I didn't own either on a single team. But now they've got post-hype possibilities, in potential platoon situations they can win. (No way I'd put 15 overall ranks between them outside a mock draft.) The way LaDainian Tomlinson ran out of gas late in'10 made me give Shonn A.J. Greene a nice little boost, despite his two meager touchdowns. How do you solve a problem like Brandon Lloyd? Fantasy's number 1 receiver in'10 has the whiff of a fluke about him, and absolutely can't come close to repeating if Tim Tebow starts the season under center. But even with Kyle Orton throwing it to him, Brandon Lloyd figures to regress. Maybe Team 3 will have a steal of steals here, but I'm glad to let someone else bet that Broncos will stay pass-happy under John Fox. I dropped Ryan Grant a bit after all the James Starks hype this postseason. Starks really only played well against the Eagles, of course, and in 110 career carries has a 3.8 yards-per-carry average, including the playoffs. Feh. I still think Ryan Grant is the starter, unless the Packers go into cost-cutting mode. But yeah, I have to admit, Ryan Grant looks less attractive to me now than he did at the beginning of January. Were I the Bengals, I'd be in no hurry to sign Cedric Benson. He's not bad. But he's 28 and last year proved he's not effective unless you run a straight-at-'em, power attack, and even then, he's no game breaker. We were all way too high on him last year. But if he's there at pick number 65, I mean, sure, I'll bite. A.J. Green is the first rookie off my board before we know where any of the first-year players will land. He could be a top-five pick in April, which would put him on a team in dire need of a number 1 receiver. He's good. Remember: the best rookie receivers ( Mike DeAngelo Williams, Dez Bryant, Jacoby Ford) were at least as valuable as the best rookie rushers (LeGarrette Blount, Ryan Mathews, Chris Ivory) in'10. Of course, not to be outdone by much, Mark Ingram comes off the board just three spots later. Especially for a rusher, it all depends where he gets drafted. Certainly there's not 22 picks' worth of value between Josh Freeman and Ben Roethlisberger, but that's what happens when you're the number 10 quarterback, unless teams get jumpy and start drafting backups. When he was healthy, Ryan Torain sure was better than an eighth-round pick. But you can't count on him being healthy, now can you, Team 3? The first defense off the board in the ninth round? Seems OK to me, though I'm rarely that owner. You know in most non-pro drafts, of course, someone's grabbing one in the fifth. What I like most about the Packers D/ST this year is that we thought they'd be elite in'10, and they were. Clearly, if Mike Tolbert's neck is healthy (it's supposed to be) and if he stays at the top of a committee with Ryan Mathews (that's less clear), he's severely under-priced here. Santana Moss takes a tumble from my January ranks because the Redskins surprisingly (to me) voided his contract. We don't know where he'll play; it's not hard to imagine he'll land with a worse quarterback than Donovan McNabb. Mikel Leshoure could be a late-first-round pick in the April draft. I'd like to see him paired with a vulnerable veteran like Cedric Benson or Joseph Addai. I like him a lot. Maybe Lynch builds on his miraculous playoff scamper against the Saints and reminds us why he was a first-round pick for the Bills a few years back. I mean, the guy turns 25 in April. Hard not to admire Team 6's young quarterback duo of Sam Bradford and Josh Freeman, considering where they were drafted. Ivory had a shockingly good rookie year, but his Lisfranc injury and the screw inserted in his ankle don't bode well for a full-time gig. Don't expect the Saints to suddenly get religion when it comes to committing to one rusher. Jordy Nelson enters the ranks of obvious sleepers after he seemed to bypass butterfingered James Jones during Packers's title run. Team 3 reaches for Ben Golden Tate in the 11th for obvious reasons: if Arian Foster winds up being a trick of the eye, the Texans will likely hand it to Golden Tate a lot. This would clearly be too early for Golden Tate otherwise. Mike Goodson could be in line for a decent role in a run-heavy Panthers attack if DeAngelo Mike DeAngelo Williams goes elsewhere; Team 8 (who selected Jonathan Stewart) is ticked not to have Goodson last one more spot. Imagine seeing Steve Smith and Randy Santana Moss as the wraparound picks of the 11th and 12th rounds? The first and second rounds would've seemed more likely as recently as last year. Santana Moss's fate as a late-round gambit is probably sealed. But Steve Smith turns only 32 in May, and a trade from Panthers would shoot him up the draft board. Ronnie Brown's problems weren't just related to a committee last season. His September was strong, but he lost something after that. It's very unlikely he'll be back with the Dolphins, and it's even unlikelier he'll ever emerge again as a fantasy savior. Team 5 waited to take Rashad Jennings right about where I think he should go. But for an MJD owner, that was a bold risk. A round earlier might be safer if you take the Maurice James Jones-Drew plunge. Team 2's handcuff of Javon Ringer was done more safely. Watch out for Jerome Simpson's name as a hot sleeper this summer. The former second-rounder ended'10 with two big games, and maybe that sound you heard was the light clicking on. The man Jerome Simpson replaced, Terrell Owens, had much more left in the tank last year than I believed possible, and shouldn't be downgraded because of the knee injury that ruined his fantasy playoffs. That said, he won't be back with the Bengals, and until we know where he lands, I'm back to worrying he'll be a fringe player. So many questions surrounding Chad Ochocinco. Will we all have to start calling him \"Chris Johnson\" again? Will he be laboring for a different team? Will Carson Palmer mutiny if he's not? Regardless, The Ocho has lost a deep step. Is Tim Tebow the Week 1 starter in Broncos? There's no way of knowing for now, but there's also no reason to avoid him late in a 10-team draft. There are always other backup options available. Yeah, I know: Tony Gonzalez in the 15th? That's heresy! He'll be someone's fantasy starter in your league this year, I'm sure. But the end is nigh. Golden Tate did next to nothing in his disappointing rookie season, but six months out, I'm ready to gamble on his talent in the late rounds. That may change.

He was 50. Dolphins-Dade Police Detective Robert Williams says the body of a Dave Duerson was found Thursday in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla. Computer records show that the Duerson who lived at the address was born the same month and year as the player. Investigators have not determined the cause of death. Williams says detectives are awaiting the medical examiner's report. \"Our family asks that you please remember Dave as a good, kind, and caring man,\" Duerson's ex-wife, Alicia Duerson, said, according to NBCBears.com. \"He loved and cherished his family and friends and was extremely proud of his beloved Notre Dame and... Bears. Please keep Dave and our family in your prayers.\" The Bears selected Duerson in the third round of the 1983 draft after an All-America career at Notre Dame. He became a full-time starter for the 1985 \"Super Bowl Shuffle\" team that was known for its dominating defense. That team finished the regular season 15-1 and had two shutouts in the playoffs before dismantling the Patriots 46-10 in the Super Bowl. \"We really liked him a lot,\" former Bears coach Mike Ditka said on \"The Waddle & Silvy Show\" on ESPN 1000. \"That was the year that Todd Bell and [Al] Harris held out. [Duerson] stepped right in and became a starter at the strong safety position and was outstanding. Did a great, great job.\" He was selected to four Pro Bowls from 1986 to 1989. He had seven sacks and six interceptions in 1986. \"We are stunned and saddened to hear the tragic news regarding Dave Duerson,\" the Bears said in a statement. \"He was a great contributor to our team and the Bears community. Today is a difficult day for all of us who loved Dave. We'll miss him. Our prayers are with his family.\" Duerson left the Bears after the 1989 season and was part of the 1990 Giants team that also won a Super Bowl. He played three more seasons for the Cardinals before retiring at age 33. He finished with 20 interceptions in his career. After football, Duerson owned Brooks Sausage Company, later called Fair Oaks Farms, which supplied sausage to fast-food restaurants. He sold the business in 2002. Duerson was born and raised in Muncie, Ind., where he was a standout in football, baseball and basketball. He earned a degree in economics from Notre Dame. Emery Moorehead, a tight end on the'85 team, said: \"He was a man's man. Smoked cigars. Just a personable guy.... He had a lot of people that loved him everywhere.\" \"Our hearts go out to the Duerson family and to all those who knew Dave,\" Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said in a statement. \"In addition to being a great football player, Dave represented himself and the University in so many other ways as a team captain, as well as through his work with the Monogram Club and the Board of Trustees. You couldn't help but be impressed by him when you met Dave Duerson, and I think that was the reaction from anyone who was ever around him.\" Ray Ellis, the sports channel director at Voice America Sports, where Duerson had a weekly radio show streamed live over the Internet, said he tried reaching Duerson on Thursday when he didn't host his regular program. Friday morning, a friend informed Ellis of Duerson's death. \"If you looked at him visually, Dave Duerson looked like he could play strong safety today,\" Ellis said. He added that Duerson recently told him he'd gotten engaged and planned to marry in late spring or early summer. Ellis said Duerson's show wasn't typical sports talk. He talked about a range of subjects and liked to highlight athletes' accomplishments and good work off the field. \"There was so much more to Dave than being a former Bears Bear,\" Ellis said. \"Dave took pride in his accomplishments off the field.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6135463", "Entities": ["Bears", "Dolphins", "Patriots", "Giants", "Cardinals"]}, {"title": "Gone too soon", "author": "Melissa Isaacson", "date": "Feb 19, 2011", "content": "Mike Singletary grappled to make sense of it, but it was a losing proposition. \"This really throws me; I just don't get it,\" he said. \"I'm just really thrown off by this whole thing.\" Mike Singletary did not yet know the cause of death of his friend and former teammate Dave Duerson, who was found Thursday night in his Dolphins home. The Dolphins-Dade medical examiner's office was not saying Friday, nor were the police until their investigation was completed. Until then, Mike Singletary and the rest were left with only the sad conclusion that, at age 50, Duerson was gone too soon. \"Absolutely everything I heard about Dave -- and when I talked to him -- was that he was in good spirits and doing fine, he was engaged, and really just living life at his best,\" Mike Singletary said. Some had heard vaguely of financial difficulties after Duerson had made an initial success of a multimillion-dollar sausage company in the early 1990s. A misdemeanor domestic battery charge led to his abrupt resignation from Notre Dame's board of trustees in 2005. But in recent years, and to those who spoke with him this past fall during activities celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Bears' Super Bowl win, Duerson appeared happy and healthy. \"I knew he had gone through some hard times with business and through his divorce, but he seemed fine,\" said former Bears coach and current ESPN analyst Mike Ditka. \"We talked at the reunion, and I asked how everything was going and he said fine. There was no animosity at that point.\" Any potential conflict with Ditka stemmed from comments the coach had made years before insinuating that the NFL Players Association, for which Duerson had served as a player rep and later as a member of its executive board and a trustee for its pension plan, was insensitive to former players' needs. Duerson, former Bears player rep Trace Armstrong said, was passionate about taking care of players from all eras, testifying before Congress in'07 on the NFL player retirement plan. \"Dave cared about the game, and he cared about players,\" said Armstrong, who served with Duerson on the union's executive board. \"More than anything, he was interested in fairness. That's one of the things I will remember about him, being a great advocate for players and what was fair.\" Mike Singletary said Duerson always took time, when he played for the Bears, to advise teammates on life outside football. \"He just did things the right way,\" Mike Singletary said. \"He was a bright guy and he helped a lot of our guys with investments, making decisions, encouraged them to go back to school, all those things. That was what Dave was about.\" When Bears cornerback Mike Richardson was looking at a maximum 13-year prison sentence for drug possession in 2006, among those who spoke on his behalf to Judge Marc Kelly, a Notre Dame grad, was Duerson, Richardson's former roommate. \"It might have made the difference between me being free today,\" Richardson said. Richardson said he spoke to Duerson a few weeks ago in Bears after Duerson asked him to be a guest on a radio show he was hosting. \"I wasn't available but we did get a chance to talk, and he sounded like Dave, upbeat,\" Richardson said. \"I felt if anybody was going through anything and needed to speak to someone, I'd be the perfect person. But he didn't give me any indication he was going through any pain.\" That was not unusual. \"For several years, Dave and I were roommates for all the road games, and he never indicated anything was bothering him, even when Buddy [Ryan] was saying he wasn't as good as Todd Bell or that he was a small part of the defense or whatever he was saying,\" Richardson recalled. \"He always had a smile to hide everything else he was going through.\" The starting strong safety on the'85 Super Bowl champion squad, Duerson's distinction was, well, distinctive. A third-round draft pick out of Notre Dame two years earlier, Duerson had the unenviable task of replacing Bell, a Pro Bowl safety, a contract holdout and one of the hard-nosed defensive coordinator's all-time favorites. (Bell died of a heart attack in 2005 at age 46.) Duerson won the starting job, became one of the top playmakers on the team -- Mike Singletary even going so far as to call him the MVP of a defense with three future Hall of Famers -- and, beginning in'86, was named to the next four Pro Bowls. \"He was a great player,\" said a stunned Ryan, just receiving the news. \"He did everything. He was a linebacker, a safety, sometimes even a corner. We asked so much of him coverage-wise. But we didn't have time to wait. We loaded him up with a lot of stuff mentally and physically.\" The physical stuff Duerson could handle. The mental part was a different story, and Duerson admitted this past fall in an interview for ESPNBears.com's series on the'85 Bears that he did resent Ryan's treatment, which was standard for the coach in handling rookies. \"The plan for me out of Notre Dame was to go to Harvard Law School, but I hadn't done it yet and the day I got to the Bears, Buddy said,'Well, you won't be here too long,'\" Duerson said. Duerson said he called his father, who was awarded five Bronze Stars in World War II and fought in Normandy, for a little advice. \"That was my hero, and he was an awesome man,\" Duerson said. \"I told him,'I didn't go through college to go through this.' My dad thought every male child should serve two years in the military, and he said,'It sounds to me like you're in the Army.' \"What I learned from him was perseverance. I never flinched; I never reacted no matter what [Ryan] said or did. I was going to be the bigger man.\" Mike Singletary, one of Duerson's closest friends on the team, said each player had to survive Ryan's trials on his own. \"We all had to handle it in our own way. Buddy didn't like any rookies that came in, but Dave had to lick his wounds,\" Mike Singletary said. \"He took it a little more personal than most of us, but I really think Buddy was just trying to help Dave be the best he could be and there was nothing personal by it.\" Both Duerson and Ryan said that when they saw each other in recent years, there was always a handshake and often a hug. \"Most rookies thought I didn't like them because I was on them all time to hurry their progress,\" Ryan said. \"But we got along. He was a normal rookie that way. And I was proud he made the Pro Bowl. That was great.\" On Friday, it was with a mixture of shock and sadness that these men absorbed the bad news. \"Dave made plays everywhere, every week,\" Mike Singletary said, \"but what I remember is his smile and his tremendous attitude about life. Every time Dave and I talked, everything was great, and I'd say,'Wait a minute, things can't always be great.' \"That was something that was just really special about him.\" Melissa Isaacson is a columnist for ESPNBears.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/columns/story?columnist=isaacson_melissa&id=6137245", "Entities": ["Mike Singletary", "Dolphins", "Bears"]}, {"title": "Scouts Eye: NFC East offensive lines", "author": "Matt Williamson", "date": "Feb 21, 2011", "content": "Each Monday, Matt Williamson from Scouts Inc. will break down a key position group in a division.

It would not surprise me at all if New York used a first-round pick on a big man up front. Injuries were a big problem this past season, and there was much more shuffling than anyone would like, but there is some versatility here and maybe that shuffling will pay off going forward. Age has become an issue as well. Still, New York has one of the best right sides in the league with Kareem McKenzie and Chris Snee. David Diehl has been the left tackle but his skills better suit playing guard. He really had a poor season overall. Rich Seubert played well, though, and should start at guard or center if he can recover from knee injury. C Shaun O'Hara couldn't stay healthy and his play slipped, and William Beatty doesn't look like the long-term answer at left tackle. Both can contribute, though.

He was 80. Matson died Saturday of respiratory failure surrounded by family at his home in Los Angeles, his nephew Art Thompson III told The Associated Press. Thompson said Matson had been mostly bedridden for several years due to a form of dementia. He said Matson hadn't spoken in four years. As a senior at the University of 49ers, Matson led the nation in rushing yardage and touchdowns while leading the Dons to an undefeated season. He was the number 1 pick of the Bears Cardinals and third overall in the 1952 NFL draft, and went on to share rookie of the year honors with Hugh McElhenny of the 49ers. Matson played with the Cardinals from 1952-58 before being traded to the Los Angeles Rams for nine players. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1957. He spent 1959-62 with the Rams, then played a single season for the Lions before finishing his career with Eagles from 1964-66. Matson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972, and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976. He was a six-time Pro Bowl selection, winning MVP of the 1956 game. He also made the All-Pro team seven times. Matson earned a silver medal in the 1,600-meter relay and a bronze in the 400 meters at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. Born May 1, 1930, in Trinity, Texas, Ollie Genoa Matson II moved to 49ers when he was in high school. After graduation from George Redskins High, where he developed into one of the city's greatest prep athletes, he enrolled at City College of 49ers. He spent one year there before transferring to USF. Thompson said before his uncle's health declined in the past week, he could walk with assistance and his children often took him on outings. \"For those in his family, he was'The Man,'\" said Thompson, a former sports writer for The Orange County Register. \"Whether it was barbecuing, listening to his collection of Dinah Redskins and Sam Cooke albums, winning games of skill, giving sage advice to the younger generation or just maintaining a calm steady hand... we all felt his positive influence.\" Matson is survived by his children Lisa, Ollie III, Bruce and Barbara; his twin sister Ocie Thompson; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

Dr. Bruce Hyma, the chief medical examiner for Dolphins-Dade County, declined to comment on the case in an e-mailed response to questions from the AP. He referred inquiries to the police department. A Dolphins-Dade police supervisor said the department had no information to release Saturday regarding the cause of Duerson's death.

They met with Cohen for the first time Friday after agreeing to the mediation, which is not binding but is meant as a way to initiate progress in the slow and sometimes contentious bargaining. The plan calls for several days of negotiations with Cohen, who asked participants to not make any public comments on the process. Neither Goodell nor Smith stopped to take questions as they left Jeff Saturday's meeting. Asked while he got into a waiting car if he were sure he didn't want to comment at all about the negotiations, Goodell replied, \"That, I'm sure of.\" The current collective bargaining agreement runs out at the end of the day March 3. The players believe that team owners are preparing to lock them out as soon as the following day, which could threaten the 2011 season. The NFL has not lost games to a work stoppage since 1987. Among those joining Goodell on Jeff Saturday: NFL counsel and lead labor negotiator Jeff Pash; league senior vice president and treasurer Joe Siclare; and outside lawyer Bob Batterman, who was working for the NHL when it lost its entire 2004-05 season to a lockout. Smith was accompanied by at least a dozen people, a much larger union contingent than was seen Friday. In addition to Kessler and another lawyer, Richard Berthelsen, the union was represented by Colts center Jeff Saturday, Jets fullback Tony Richardson, Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch, and former players Pete Kendall and Sean Morey. None would reveal anything about what went on during Jeff Saturday's talks, but Jeff Saturday noted: \"Nothing can be done without communicating.\" Indeed, the start of mediation could be a positive sign after several months of infrequent negotiations -- and frequent rhetoric, including charges from each side that the other was hoping for a work stoppage.

A second-round pick could net Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton. Carson Palmer continues to campaign for a trade that isn't being considered by Bengals ownership. At some point, Donovan McNabb will be released or traded by the Redskins. The quarterback trade market could be hot and heavy, but all those plans are on hold until owners and players see whether they can hash out a labor agreement. No agreement means no trades, so, for now, teams have to take a close look at the quarterbacks in the draft, starting at the scouting combine this week. For the eight to 10 teams needing quarterbacks, the job is tough. With Peyton Eli Manning and Michael Vick franchised, the only true free-agent option is Seahawks's Matt Hasselbeck, but, until March 3, only the Seahawks can sign him. You get the feeling that teams such as Cardinals, 49ers, Dolphins, Vikings and others would prefer to go for a veteran quarterback. New 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh is seriously considering re-signing Alex Smith because options are so slim at the moment. What will be interesting is seeing how the teams in need of quarterbacks react to the ones available in the draft. Cam Newton and Blaine Gabbert head into the combine as the top quarterbacks, but neither is considered the sure top pick Sam Bradford was last season. If there is a lengthy lockout, quarterback-needy teams might have to inflate the ratings of the quarterbacks in this draft. On the surface, this draft looks deep on quarterback prospects, but it's questionable whether a team can secure that potential elite quarterback of the future. It's not the 2004 class of Eli Peyton Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger. It's not the 2008 class that produced Matt Ryan, Joe Flacco and Josh Freeman. For the moment, though, the stage is set for the draft choices. Q: Do you think that the Seahawks would have any interest in Matt Leinart? They could probably get him for very little. I'm not sold on Charlie Whitehurst as a backup because he just seems way too comfortable being just that. I think Pete Carroll could reach Leinart, and I've seen flashes of potential. Ron in Renton, Wash. A: A free agent, Leinart would be an option because Pete Carroll knows him, and you're right, he probably would come cheap. Pete Carroll's first mission is to re-sign Matt Hasselbeck. Then, at least he has a starting quarterback. Leinart, a backup with the Texans last season, is considered a flawed quarterback and can't be counted on to be a starter. If Matt Hasselbeck is signed, Pete Carroll could decide whether Leinart is a better option than Whitehurst and his $4 million salary. The Seahawks also could draft a quarterback in the first round and use him as a backup. Q: What will be the status of rookies in the event of a lockout? Are they part of the union, given that they have never signed an NFL contract? Is it possible for the owners to sign them and have them start practicing before the lockout ends? Parker in Seahawks A: Rookies aren't part of the union until they sign their first contract. If there is a lockout, no one will be able to sign a contract until a collective bargaining agreement is complete. There will be no minicamps for them to attend in event of a lockout. They will be in limbo like everyone else if no labor deal is struck. Q: It seems that quarterbacks are constantly judged by their win-loss records, specifically if they have won a Super Bowl, but coaches seem to get off the hook sometimes. Jeff Fisher is a case in point. He had six winning seasons out of 16. How does someone with this type of record coach for 16 seasons, and why is he considered a hot candidate for other teams? Tony in Lackawanna, N.Y. A: Numbers don't lie, but sometimes they don't tell the whole story. Perception plays a big role. Jeff Fisher, who coached the Texans Oilers/Titans from 1994 to 2010, took over a franchise down on talent. The move out of Texans pulled down the franchise, but Jeff Fisher kept the players disciplined and playing well. Once the move to Nashville was secure, his coaching created a winning environment that fans and players believed in. Losing franchises have trouble selling tickets. Jeff Fisher won over the fans with his coaching and the style of play of his team. Owners around the NFL saw what he did with the Titans, and that's why he will be a hot coaching candidate next year. Q: Can you please explain the difference in franchise tag salaries between Peyton Eli Manning ($23 million) and Michael Vick ($16 million). How/why can the top-five average salaries benefit Peyton Eli Manning more than Michael Vick? Josh in Redskins, D.C. A: Very simple. Under the franchise tag, a player gets 120 percent of his previous season cap number or the average of the top-five cap numbers from the previous year, whichever is greater. Peyton Eli Manning had a cap number in the $19 million range. The 120 percent increase took him to $23 million. Michael Vick got the top-five average, which was $16 million. Q: How [do] the NFL's TV contracts figure in to the CBA negotiations? Does the NFL still get paid by the networks if there are no games due to a lockout? Joe in Everett, Wash. A: The networks fronted the NFL about $4 billion in case there is a lockout in 2011. It's not a gift. It's a loan. Ultimately, the networks will get every game they paid for, but the $4 billion loan was granted to give the owners leverage in the collective bargaining negotiations. It will be a disaster to the networks and all involved if there is a lockout that carries into the regular season and affects the games. This is high-stakes, big-money poker. The networks gave the owners a huge deck of cards. Q: I thought Cortez Kennedy would've been a first-ballot Hall of Fame no-brainer. He was a dominant D-lineman in his time, so I was surprised to not see him in the final five. Is there still hope? Craig in Los Angeles A: The current backlog of great players makes it hard for any great player to be a no-brainer. It took former Bears defensive lineman Richard Dent nine years of eligibility to make it. I believe Kennedy, who starred with Seahawks from 1990 to 2000, will make it next year. He was a dominant player and one of the greatest defensive tackles in NFL history. Like Hall of Famer Andre Tippett of the Patriots, Kennedy was a standout, but often for losing teams. Great players on consistent winners have an easier chance of making the Hall of Fame. Ultimately, all the great ones get in, and Kennedy will be wearing the yellow jacket. Q: I have heard a lot about the \"Super Bowl Loser Curse.\" Well, correct me if I am wrong, but hasn't the Super Bowl winner lost its first playoff game every year since the Patriots in 2006? Why has this happened, and will it happen to the Packers? Josh in Cowboys A: The Super Bowl curse is a reality. It could affect the Packers in 2011. Because the Super Bowl goes into February, injured players have less time to heal their injuries than those on non-Super Bowl teams. Contract problems flare up. Coaches on other teams study the Super Bowl teams more than others and figure out ways to stop them.

A league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the Vikings used the \"non-exclusive\" franchise tag on Chad Greenway. Chad Greenway has led the team in tackles for three straight seasons. He was chosen the team's 2010 defensive MVP and had 144 tackles. He will be entering his sixth season, including a rookie season that he sat out with a knee injury. If the franchise tag designation stays in its current form in the next collective bargaining agreement, Chad Greenway stands to make nearly $10 million next season. But the Vikings would like to get a long-term deal done with the 28-year-old, which would negate that number. \"Chad's an important part of our team and his play speaks for itself,\" coach Leslie Frazier said in a statement on the team's website. \"He's productive and has continued to improve each year he has been in the NFL. \"He's a leader for us in the locker room and on the field.\" Many players chafe at the designation, viewing it as an obstacle in their way of a long-term contract with big guaranteed money. But in a statement issued by the team, Chad Greenway said he was \"happy to know that the Vikings value me enough to make this move.\" He said he looked forward to playing for Leslie Frazier, defensive coordinator Fred Pagac and new linebackers coach Mike Singletary next season, and well into the future. \"It's been a goal of mine since getting drafted to play with the Vikings my whole career,\" he said. \"I think we're one step closer to that now.\" The decision to tag Chad Greenway means that neither wide receiver Sidney Rice nor defensive end Ray Edwards will be tagged and each potentially could become a free agent depending on what happens with the ongoing collective bargaining agreement talks. The current CBA will expire at the end of the day on March 3 and owners might lock out the players if a new deal isn't signed. Since the Vikings didn't use the \"exclusive\" tag, Chad Greenway can negotiate with other teams. If he receives an offer, the Vikings can either match the other club's offer or receive two first-round draft choices as compensation. Teams have until Thursday to use their franchise tag. So far, only quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Michael Vick have received exclusive franchise tags, barring them from talking to other teams during the free-agency period.

Now he's working to ensure there eventually will be more football players from his parents' homeland. \"I see so much potential,\" Wang said during a clinic Tuesday for university students playing in a 32-school flag football league. \"Just these kids... they were just picking it up so fast. Just how smart they were and how they just soaked everything up. It was just so incredible,\" Wang said. Both of his parents were born in China and represented the country in the 1984 Olympics before moving to the U.S. later in the decade. His visit was part of the NFL's efforts to build a fan base in China, where football remains largely unknown. The league is hoping visits by players such as their new Chinese-American star will help change that. During the clinic, about 70 student players practiced physical conditioning and ran passing drills before playing a high-spirited scrimmage. Joining Wang in instructing were Vikings wide receiver Sidney Rice, along with former players Jack Brewer and Barrett Green. Among those taking part, Beijing university student He Xin said he started playing flag football after it was introduced in physical education class. It's now become a hobby and the exposure to professional players such as Wang was a great opportunity to learn more, He said. \"More and more players are taking it up and I think there's a bright future ahead for football in China, even though there's still a big gap in understanding among Chinese,\" said He, a third-year student at Beijing's number 2 Foreign Languages Institute. Wang is in China for the first time in a decade and will travel to Shanghai later in the week for more events. The Virginia native was selected out of Virginia Tech in the fifth round of the 2010 draft. After being hampered by a thumb injury to start the season, Wang appeared in six of Bills's games at left tackle. \"I learned the system, understood the game,\" Wang said. His trip to China has rekindled some old memories. On Monday, he visited the Beijing sports academy where his parents trained -- his father, Robert, was a high jumper, and his mother, Nancy, ran the 100-meter hurdles -- and where he himself worked out during a two-month family visit 10 years ago, a time when he said he first realized his athletic potential. \"That's really where I started to pick up being good at sports, so it all really started there. So a lot of me thanks them for that,\" Wang said. Wang's rise to professional success has drawn frequent comparisons to Texans Rockets center Yao Ming, although Yao was born and raised in China. The 6-foot-5, 314-pound Wang said he was flattered by the comparison. \"Hopefully I can live up to that and help expand football to China. That's what I'm aiming for,\" he said. Chinese-American athletes would continue to push into new areas, Wang said, citing the growing number of Asian players in high school football programs. Building a market for football in China, however, still may take years. The NFL opened an office in Beijing in 2007 and has been recruiting media partners to broadcast games both on television and live streaming on websites, including QQ and Sina.com. \"There is no real basis or history of football in China so we rely a lot on the media to educate people about the game,\" said Stephanie Hsiao, the NFL's China marketing manager. As for staging an NFL exhibition game in China, Hsiao said that was a goal, but no date had been set. At least four current or former NFL players boast partial Chinese ancestry, including Patriots second-year safety Patrick Chung.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6146355", "Entities": ["Bills", "Vikings", "Sidney Rice", "Texans", "Patriots", "Patrick Chung"]}, {"title": "Tagging Michael Vick was a mistake", "author": "Bill Barnwell", "date": "Feb 22, 2011", "content": "When NFL teams yank a free agent off the market by tagging him as their franchise player, they make what amounts to a financial trade-off. Without having to sign the player to a long-term contract or expose him to the open market, the organization can just about ensure that they will have that player on their roster for the upcoming season. On the other hand, there's a tradeoff: namely, a boatload of cash. Franchise players get a salary equivalent to that of the average compensation of the top five players at their position or 120 percent of their previous salary, whichever is greater. That can be a pretty hefty raise. Michael Vick made about $4.5 million in 2010, but after receiving the exclusive rights franchise tag from the Eagles his 2011 compensation could hit $20 million -- guaranteed the moment he signs his tender. We know that teams place the franchise tag on players for a variety of reasons, like gaining leverage in negotiating a potential long-term contract or ensuring the presence of a stopgap while a younger player develops. The uncertain future of the league's contractual system also plays a unique role this offseason. Even with all those options, there were still some curious choices for franchise tags this year. While nobody doubts the choice by the Colts to lock up Peyton Manning, we're going to examine some of those borderline choices by teams. We know they're paying top-five money, but are they really locking up top-five talent? There were times in 2010 when Michael Vick looked like one of the five best players in NFL history, let alone a top-five quarterback. And Andy Reid might have been run out of town if he had let Michael Vick leave in free agency without acquiring any compensation in return. But when it comes to playing as a top-five quarterback in 2011, the odds -- and the numbers -- are against Michael Vick.

That's the question leading off this week's Patriots Mailbag. But for those tired of receiver talk and if the Patriots truly need a deep receiving threat, there is more to digest deeper in the mailbag. The topics explored include the upcoming NFL combine and draft, as well as potential free-agent targets. Q. Mike, let's talk Randy Moss. I think you're kidding yourself on this one, along with any one else who thinks there's a chance he could return or be a good fit. There's a reason the Pats traded him and it wasn't because they were looking for another draft pick. Who trades a Hall of Fame receiver during the climax of the regular season? The answer: Someone who doesn't want him. Have you ever broken up with a girl and then talked yourself into the idea that'things will be different' to return for one more round of heartache? I bet Bill Belichick has too and he won't make the same mistake twice. Thoughts? -- Gabe (49ers) A. Gabe, here is the scenario in which I could envision Moss' return: He tells Bill Belichick he had it wrong last year, has a new outlook on what's important, and would accept a one-year salary at $2.2 million with incentives that could push it higher -- putting him in line with Wes Welker and Deion Branch. Is it likely to happen? Probably not, in part because it could block the development of younger receivers, but that's the thought I've been bouncing around in recent weeks. Q. Hi Mike, the failure of Tom Brady to read and pass to open receivers and his easily rattled state in the Jets game does not negate the value or necessity of picking up a stretch-the-field wide receiver. An addition would have to be someone ready to accept a quite reduced salary who wanted a last chance or two to win a Super Bowl and who did not require a learning curve. Randy Moss fits that description if he was agreeable to both the money and the old Patriot style pass game-plan. He would also get to be back with the ones he most admires in the NFL -- Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. It seems like a win/win to me, so why not get on it now? -- Jake M. (Vancouver) A. Jake, the big question would be \"Which Moss are you getting?\" If it's the 2007 version -- which was the player who cut his salary and was looking to simply fit in while reviving his career after struggling in Raiders -- I see the possibility. Otherwise, I think Gabe has it right in the question leading off this week's mailbag. Something tells me there were more things happening behind the scenes with Moss that contributed to his exit. Q. Hey Mike, I know you've been back and forth with the idea of the Patriots exploring bringing Randy Moss back next year. I'm in the camp of the Patriots adding another deep threat veteran WR to help out our other receivers. I think if we had that type of receiver in the playoff loss to the Jets (I know we had some other missed opportunities), the outcome might have been different. We got by with the revamped offense for the rest of the season, but the Jets were ready for it. If we add a deep threat, teams need to game plan for that wideout and will open things up for others. With this in mind, do you see the Patriots exploring trade options for Chad Ochocinco, Steve Aldon Smith, or possibly even Larry Fitzgerald? I also think taking a look at TO might not be a bad option either. Your thoughts? -- Grant (Columbus, Ohio) A. Grant, on the whole, I don't rate wide receiver as a top need. I could see the Patriots going in that direction if the opportunity is too good to pass up, but I put it behind defensive line, outside linebacker, offensive line and even running back in terms of need. I am of the mindset that the final eight games of the season looked pretty good on offense (the Patriots scored 30-plus points each game) before things fizzled out in the playoffs. It's easy to remember the last game but my view is that the overall body of work wasn't bad at all. Now, if the Patriots were to say \"We have top receivers Deion Branch and Wes Welker entering the final year of their contracts and we want to plan more for the future,\" I could see that possibility in adding a receiver in the draft. I just don't think the playoff loss was reflective of what we saw all season. I don't see Terrell Owens as someone the Patriots would take on, and I find it hard to believe Cardinals will let Larry Fitzgerald go. I do like Steve Aldon Smith, depending on the price to acquire him. Q. Steve Aldon Smith for the 60th (2nd-round) pick in the draft. If you are Patriots, do you do the trade? If you are Panthers? I say yes to both. -- Pete (Santa Fe, NM) A. Pete, I'd go for it from a Patriots perspective. I still don't know why Panthers would let go of one of its best assets. Steve Aldon Smith is a top competitor in my book. Q. Hi Mike, I feel that a wide receiver to stretch the field is not a huge priority. We won three Super Bowls without one and lost one with one. I also hate to admit it but Tom Brady's accuracy deep down field is not that good. Moss' ability to catch helped greatly in 2007. Let's get the \"D\" back where it should be. Your thoughts please? -- Charlie B. (Richmond Hill, Ga.) A. Charlie, I'm more in line with your thought process. I think the Patriots need to get back to controlling the line of scrimmage more regularly on defense. That's where I would start when identifying areas of need this offseason. Q. Mike, I was hoping you could give some names of blue-chip pass-rushing d-linemen or pass-rushing outside backers. I'm not a college football fan, and rely on the experts to supply that info for me. -- Mike (Brockton, Mass.) A. Mike, this is projected to be a good year for defensive ends, with both ESPN analyst Todd McShay and NFL Network's Mike Mayock projecting eight or nine going in the first round. Here are some names to keep on the radar in the first two rounds for the Patriots: Akeem Ayers (UCLA), Robert Quinn (North Panthers), Aldon Steve Aldon Smith (Missouri), Justin Texans (Georgia) and Chris Carter (Fresno State). These are players who would project to rush end in a sub package or outside linebacker in the 3-4. Q. Hey Mike, I'm glad to hear that this year's draft projects to be strong in the OLB/DE areas, as I see this as the Pats' two biggest areas of need. Honestly though, I saw these as areas of need in last year's draft, and was appalled when they took Devin McCourty (I was way wrong, happy to admit it). It really just seems like there's no way to project who BB is going to grab with any of his picks, and that positional need doesn't factor in much, if at all. What do you think? -- Zack (Somerville) A. Zack, I think there is truth to that, because it's all based on opportunity on how the board falls. So if the Patriots have a chance to pick the top running back at number 17 (widely regarded as Alabama's Mark Ingram) or number 5-rated outside linebacker who might have a lower grade overall, I could see the Patriots going the former route. In the end, I think the best philosophy is not to force need and pick good football players. You usually can't go wrong that way. Q. Mike, do the Patriots subscribe to the NFL scouting service that covers the combine? What is the real value of the combine? -- Joefla (Orlando) A. Joefla, the Patriots have not been part of BLESTO, the national scouting service that shares information among teams subscribing to its service. The Patriots view their operation as system-specific, meaning they grade players based on how they would fit into their system, and thus they view the BLESTO grades as not best applying to their program. Q. Mike, I am very much inclined to think the Patriots need a stud running back who can also pick up the blitz and catch out of the backfield. I think Oklahoma running back, Demarco Murray would be a great fit. This would force defenses to respect the run more. Your thoughts? -- Brian B. (Pierre, SD) A. Brian, I have little doubt that the Patriots will be drafting a running back, and possibly even signing a free agent at the position to complement BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Danny Woodhead. Murray could be that guy -- his physical build is a bit different from a running back in that he looks receiver-like at times -- but I think it's a stretch to think he becomes that number 1A stud from Day 1. I still envision BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Woodhead handling a big part of the load. Q. Hi Mike, are we sure that Aaron Hernandez' hip injury isn't a career-altering injury such as the one Rosevelt Colvin suffered in 2003? Back then the Pats ended up getting a player that was significantly less explosive than the one before the injury when he was in Bears. In short, will Aaron Hernandez be the same player after the surgery that he was prior to the injury? -- Tman (Belmont, Mass.) A. Tman, the surgery was the same that Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas underwent, according to Tom E. Curran of Comcast SportsNet. Curran notes that Thomas returned in time for the season and has not been affected by the injury. Q. Mike, curious about your thoughts on the D-line, and specifically where is Ron Brace at this point in his tenure with the Pats? Is he viewed as a viable starter for years to come if healthy, or an inconsistent backup? What are your thoughts on Mike Wright, Myron Pryor and Ty Warren? -- Jim K. (Northford, Conn.) A. Jim, I don't think Brace is viewed as a starter for years to come at this point. He is still developing. If Ty Warren returns to form in 2011, and is with the Patriots, I think he'd get the nod over Brace at left defensive end at this point. As for some of the other linemen, the health of Mike Wright bears watching based on how he missed the final six games of the season with a head/neck injury. I view Pryor's best fit as an interior sub rusher. With Warren, I think it's fair to wonder if he will return to form. I see no reason he can't, but as we saw with a player like Jarvis Green, sometimes the wear and tear can catch up to veterans quickly. Q. Mike, over the last 10 years or more, the Patriots, Steelers and Colts have been consistently competitive. I've been trying to figure out if there is any common factor between these three teams that could be the possible explanation. Coaches? Signing of free agents? I think I've boiled it down to a few things. All three teams show great prowess in the draft and with the second tier of free agents. All have more hits than misses. All three have consistent ownership and owners that seem to set a tone but don't micromanage. What do you think? Wouldn't you think the other teams would see the success of these three teams and try to copy their ways? -- Dave M. (Berlin, N.H.) A. Dave, I think this is an interesting topic. The first two thoughts I had is consistency within their system and strong quarterback play. Put those two together and it can take you far. When it comes to consistency within the system, I'd use the Broncos as an example. Look at what they are doing now under first-year head coach John Fox, trying to switch from a 3-4 to a 4-3. Two years ago, they were trying to switch from a 4-3 to a 3-4. Such volatility can set a team back a few years because it requires targeting players with different skill sets. All three teams aren't huge free-agent spenders, so they instead focus on drafting and developing. They generally do a good job at it, although it looks to me like Colts is in a little slump right now when looking at their draft picks in the first three rounds since 2006. Q. Mike, it could be a unusual offseason if the players and owners don't agree on a CBA soon. I do think that it is good that they agreed on mediated discussions. Is it good sign? What kind of compromise can be made in regards to the splitting of the revenue pie? That seems to be the most critical issue? -- David (North Attleboro) A. David, I am not close to this story as it's more national in scope and I'm focused more closely on one team, the Patriots. But I don't think it's a stretch to say it's positive that the sides are talking. That's the only way to get a deal done. As for the splitting of the revenue pie, and the best possible compromise, I'll leave that to the national reporters who are assigned to cover that story as they have a better grasp of all the ins and outs. Q. Mike, what happens come March 4 for young players or any players that are recovering from an injury? I realize that Tom Brady has his own trainers, but will these rookies need to find their own rehab come March 4? Will the Pats training staff work to help the players find rehab that matches with the player/team's needs? -- Nancy (Haverhill, Mass.) A. Nancy, these players will be on their own, which is something recovering kicker Stephen Gostkowski talked about last week when discussing his rehab from a torn right quad. Stephen Gostkowski, for example, plans to return to the University of Memphis. I'm sure the Patriots' staff is doing its best to make sure these players have some plans, but if there is no agreement or extension by March 4, the Patriots' staffers will be hands-off with these players. Q. Hi Mike, since a lockout-shortened season will undoubtedly cause further disillusionment in cities with already-floundering attendance (Jaguars, Panthers, Raiders, etc.), any insight into how teams are putting together their ticketing strategy? How about long-term plans in preparation for no 2011 season? And any chance the Patriots shave ticket prices to appease fans should any work stoppage occur? -- Tim M. (49ers) A. Tim, right now it's business as usual when it comes to tickets. For example, the Patriots sent out renewal forms to Patriots season-ticket holders last week, with a deadline of March 31 to return payment. I've read reports in recent days of some teams raising some ticket prices (e.g. Rams, Packers). Overall, I don't see prices coming down. If anything, I see them stabilizing or going up. Q. You mentioned the possibility of signing safety Bob James Sanders, who was released by the Colts. I would love this to happen as it reminds me of when the Patriots signed Rodney Harrison after he was released by the Chargers in 2002. Thoughts? -- David (Cambridge, Mass.) A. David, I can see the link there, although I view James Sanders' injury history is more significant than Harrison's was when the Patriots signed him. I could see the Patriots exploring James Sanders as a complement to their top three safeties -- Brandon Meriweather, Patrick Chung and James Sanders -- but I don't see them getting into any type of bidding war. If they were seriously considering James Sanders, I think it would be a low-risk, high-reward situation where the contract included heavy incentives. James Sanders has scheduled visits with Jaguars and Bills, according to reports. Q. What are the chances that the Patriots acquire Nnamdi Asomugha this offseason? -- Chandler (Evans, Ga.) A. Chandler, I think it's highly unlikely. I wouldn't be surprised if Nnamdi Asomugha lands back in Raiders. I view this situation similar to Julius Peppers last year. If he's willing to come on a one-year deal, it has a chance. But I don't see the Patriots going the big-bucks route to sign him. Q. Do you think the Patriots have any interest in Marcus Stroud now that he is a free agent? -- David (Elon, N.C.) A. David, I don't see the connection with Marcus Stroud and the Patriots. I think the team would lean toward bringing back Gerard Warren if they were thinking along those lines. Q. Hi Mike, the situation with Logan Mankins has me thinking about how teams make and maintain their rosters. As an avid Patriots fan, I am increasingly tired of having my favorite players leave the team. Has there ever been any thought of the league financially rewarding NFL players for staying with their teams? I know money is pooled in the league, so how about using some of that money to reward players for staying in one place? The NFL could provide $25,000 to $100,000 for each year of continual service to the same team in addition to any amount offered by the team's contract. This would give additional incentives for players to stay put and provide the continuity that makes following a team fun. I know this sounds like it could work out to be an enormous amount of money, but I have got to think that if contracts are prevented from growing in the new CBA, with time this system would provide the players with identical incomes plus provide a built-in system to encourage longevity with the same team. -- Pats fan, Keene, N.H. A. I like the thought because, like you, I've always had a fondness of sorts for players who spend their entire career with one team. I remember writing on Tedy Bruschi on this topic a few years ago at The Boston Globe, and how passionate he was to have played for just the Patriots. The biggest obstacle I see with this scenario is money. That's a lot of cash, and it has to come from somewhere. We see players get additional money in the performance-based-pay pool, and perhaps it could be something similar to that. But, as usual, it comes down to dollars and cents, and I think it would be hard to do that. Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPN Boston.

After months of infrequent -- and sometimes contentious -- bargaining, the league and union have been communicating face-to-face since Friday. The sessions are taking place at the office of George Cohen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a U.S. government agency. The league and union agreed to try mediation in a bid to find common ground before the current labor deal expires at the end of the day March 3. The union has said it believes team owners want to lock out the players as soon as the next day, which could threaten the 2011 season. The sides met for about six hours on both Friday and Saturday, and another eight hours Sunday. Cohen announced Thursday the groups agreed to the mediation, which is not binding but is meant as a way to spur progress. The plan calls for several days of negotiations with Cohen present. \"Any time that you talk,\" Batch said, \"you have to feel better.\" He and two other current players -- Browns linebacker Scott Fujita and Jets fullback Tony Richardson -- left Monday at 5 p.m., getting into cars that were heading to the airport. It wasn't clear whether other players would take their spots with the union's negotiating team in Redskins. The NFL's group began arriving at 8 a.m. Monday, and commissioner Roger Goodell walked in alone shortly after 9 a.m. The NFL's group included general counsel and lead labor negotiator Jeff Pash and outside lawyer Bob Batterman. Smith got to Cohen's office at about 11 a.m., entering with Scott Fujita. Former players Pete Kendall and Sean Morey also were part of the union contingent Monday, along with lawyers Richard Berthelsen and Jeffrey Kessler. The league and union went more than two months without any formal bargaining until Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once the next week, then called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Among the other significant points in negotiations: the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; a rookie wage scale; and benefits for retired players.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6144207", "Entities": ["Steelers", "Browns", "Scott Fujita", "Jets", "Tony Richardson", "Redskins"]}, {"title": "Cam Newton will participate at combine", "author": null, "date": "Feb 22, 2011", "content": "FORT WORTH, Texas -- Cam Newton plans to fully participate in the NFL combine that begins later this week, saying he wants \"to be transparent\" through the whole draft process. Cam Newton intends to work out for NFL teams in Colts, and said he is ready to answer any questions they may have for the quarterback who won the BCS national championship and Heisman Trophy in his only season at Auburn, where he played in a spread offense instead of taking snaps under center. \"I don't have nothing to hide, and I'm a competitor,\" Cam Newton said Monday night before accepting the Davey O'Brien Award that recognizes the nation's top quarterback. \"I'm going to go out here and do what I've been working on this whole time and preparing for this moment right now.\" Cam Newton has been working with a quarterback coach in Chargers and getting mentoring from Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon. There was a workout for the media earlier this month that he said hopes changed some perceptions \"in a positive way.\" Projected by many to be among the top 10 picks in April's NFL draft, Cam Newton knows how important the interview process will be at the combine. \"It's just as important, if not [more] important than the play on the field,\" Cam Newton said. \"You can't overlook that by no means. If you don't sell yourself to an organization, I think you're going to be skipped in that process and I don't want to be skipped.\" The NCAA has ruled that Cam Newton's father tried to get Mississippi State to pay for him to play there. There was no evidence Cam Newton knew what his father did or that Auburn was involved, so he was allowed to keep playing. But the case is not closed. \"That's nothing I'm worried about,\" Cam Newton said. \"I understand that everybody's entitled to their own opinion, and I just feel like if I have an opportunity to speak with a person or let a person evaluate me as a person, not something that has been stereotyped, I think their perception about me will change, and I'm willing to take that risk.\" When Cam Newton arrived for a news conference before the ceremony, he first warmly greeted the high school senior girl who was being presented the O'Brien scholarship award. He then shook hands with Keith Jackson and Bob Griese, who were also being recognized Monday night. \"The guys have gotten bigger since I've played. My center with the Dolphins was 6-foot-4, 250 pounds,\" Griese said with a smile looking up at 6-6, 250-pound Cam Newton. \"You ever play center?\" The namesake of the O'Brien award, the former TCU quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy in 1938 when the Frogs won their only AP national title, was 5-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. When asked what NFL quarterback he would be like in the NFL, Cam Newton said no one in particular but a part of many of them. He mentioned Tom Brady, Michael Vick, Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers. \"Cam Newton is Cam Newton. I don't want to be symboled as he's like this type of person or he's like that type of person,\" he said. \"I'm trying to take something from every single person's game that makes them an elite quarterback.... That's what sets me apart from somebody else, that's what I train for on a daily basis to be different, to be in a category by myself.\" In his only season at Auburn, Cam Newton completed 185 of 280 passes (66 percent) for 2,854 yards and 30 touchdowns with only seven interceptions. He also ran for 1,473 yards and 20 touchdowns. \"I think I'm in control of my destiny right now, I'm lucky to be in this type of driver's seat,\" Cam Newton said. \"I'm just focusing on what I have to do, in the classroom, in the interviews, and at the end, my performance on the field.\" Auburn fans have long celebrated wins at Toomer's Corner, and one of their biggest celebrations ever came last month after Cam Newton and the Tigers won the BCS national championship over Oregon. The Tigers won all 14 games Cam Newton started. Recently, an Alabama fan was charged with first-degree criminal mischief for allegedly using a tree-destroying herbicide to poison the oak trees at Toomer's Corner after Auburn beat the Crimson Tide in November. \"Just hearing that is devastating for me. I didn't believe it, and my heart is going out to Toomer's Corner and the Toomer's trees,\" Cam Newton said. \"My heart goes out to everybody in Auburn.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2011/news/story?id=6145616", "Entities": ["Cam Newton", "Colts", "Chargers", "Dolphins", "Tom Brady", "Michael Vick", "Peyton Manning", "Aaron Rodgers"]}, {"title": "Coach praises Jay Cutler's leadership", "author": null, "date": "Feb 22, 2011", "content": "Not only does Bears coach Lovie Smith believe Jay Cutler is tougher than some perceived after his early exit from the NFC Championship Game, but Lovie Smith believes Jay Cutler actually is a great leader. \"First off, guys always watch you -- in the classroom, on the practice field and of course your play on game day.

It's been a week where we've been tapering down, going away from what we've been doing. Just grinding. Just more technique and getting smooth and getting ready for that transition for the combine. I'm excited and nervous at the same time for the combine. I'm nervous as far as putting up the right numbers, like running the 40 and the shuttle drills and making sure I get the right number. I have a goal for what I want to run the 40 in, but I want to keep that to myself right now. I live in McKinney, Texas, for the time being because I'm working out at the Michael Johnson Performance Center. It's nice and quiet out here. I can just chill and get something nice to eat.

Ryan Kalil is planning on signing the team's franchise offer sheet, a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The players' union has questioned the validity of the franchise tag for next season with the current collective bargaining agreement set to expire, so Ryan Kalil's decision to sign the offer is an interesting one. The 25-year-old Ryan Kalil is coming off his second straight Pro Bowl season. Under the franchise tag, Ryan Kalil is offered a guaranteed one-year deal at about $10.5 million. Ryan Kalil, who was drafted in the second round of the 2007 draft, is the first center to receive the franchise tag since the Lions' Kevin Glover in 1996. The Panthers' decision will allow running back DeAngelo Williams and defensive end Charles Johnson to become unrestricted free agents and potentially leave Panthers. \"It was a difficult decision,\" Panthers general manager Marty Hurney said. \"There were several guys we were considering but we only had one tag. In the end, we decided to use it to keep our offensive line intact.\" Drafted 27th overall in the 2006 draft, the 27-year-old DeAngelo Williams holds the Panthers' franchise mark for career rushing yards (4,211) and rushing touchdowns (31). In 2008, he led the NFL with 18 rushing touchdowns and 20 total scores. He made his only Pro Bowl appearance in 2009. Charles Johnson, 24, led the Panthers with 11\u00bd sacks. He was drafted in the third round of the 2007 draft. The Panthers have the option to take a defensive end with the number 1 overall pick in the draft, possibly Clemson's Da'Quan Bowers. The Panthers also need help at defensive tackle, with Auburn's Nick Fairley seen as a potential candidate for the top pick, too. After rushing for 1,515 yards in 2008 and 1,117 in 2009, DeAngelo Williams' numbers declined dramatically last season as the Panthers became the NFL's lowest-scoring team. He managed only 361 yards and was averaging 4.1 yards a carry -- a yard worse than his career average going into the season -- when he injured his foot late in a victory Oct. 24 against 49ers. When the Panthers suffered numerous other injuries and needed to sign an offensive lineman, the Panthers placed DeAngelo Williams on injured reserve Nov. 17. In 2009, DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart, 23, became the first teammates in NFL history to each rush for more than 1,000 yards. Stewart is signed through the 2012 season.

Duerson had filed for personal bankruptcy in September in Florida, according to court documents. He listed $34.6 million in assets and $14.7 million in liabilities. However, nearly all of the assets were part of a judgment his food company had won in 2004 but had never collected. Duerson's ex-wife, Alicia Duerson, said in a December court filing that Duerson owed her $70,000 and was concealing assets, according to the Bears Tribune. His assets didn't list his two Super Bowl rings and a large bronze trophy for being named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 1987. Duerson's body was found Thursday at his home in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla. He reportedly died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Duerson's family has agreed to donate his brain to Boston University's medical school for its study of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the degenerative disease that has been linked to depression, dementia and occasionally suicide in former players, according to The New York Times. Despite these financial woes, Duerson's lawyer was \"shocked\" to hear of his client's death. \"Things were looking good for his bankruptcy case,\" Zach Shelomith said, according to the Tribune. \"He seemed extremely upbeat. I see clients with financial problems all the time who are in a lot worse shape than him. When I saw the news on TV, I was shocked.\" The filing in U.S. bankruptcy court in the Southern District of Florida lists Duerson's other assets as a checking account with $846 and a 2002 Cadillac Escalade with 140,000 miles on it, valued at $5,750. Besides his wife's claim, other creditors include: \u2022 Northern Trust, which has a $213,790 mortgage on Duerson's Sunny Isles Beach property and a second lien for $233,392; \u2022 the state of Wisconsin, which has a $47,315 tax claim; \u2022 Associated Bank, which says it is owed $4 million from a 2006 debt; \u2022 Bank of America, with claims of $23,149 in credit card purchases; \u2022 Greenline Capital Partners, with a 2006 promissory note for $9 million; and \u2022 Kenosha Area Business Alliance, which claims a debt of $573,502. Filings were made in the bankruptcy case as recently as last week. In the filing, Duerson listed his year-to-date income as $16,800. An October filing says Duerson had a storage unit in Morton Grove, Ill., that he was struggling to unload. It contained a Chippendale desk, a bar and bar stools and a pool table. \"I can't begin to put a value to this stuff, as it has been impossible to sell any of it, and even difficult to give the stuff away!\" Duerson said in a memo filed with the court that was obtained by the Tribune. And \"no one wants to pick it up to sell,\" according to the memo. Duerson even said he had his two sons' trumpets from when they were children. \"They are now 25 and 26 years old,\" Duerson noted in the memo, according to the newspaper. \"At any rate, they can have everything in storage as I need to eliminate that $375-$400 a month ASAP! Thank you! DRD.\" Duerson had invested millions in Duerson Foods and built a state-of-the-art meat processing plant in 2002, but the plant's opening was delayed in 2003 due to issues with the freezer supplier. Duerson ended up mortgaging his Highland Park, Ill., house to finance the project. He eventually won a judgment against the freezer company in 2004 for $34 million, but the money was never paid, the Tribune reported, because the company filed for bankruptcy.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6146920", "Entities": ["Bears"]}, {"title": "Jets to increase ticket prices", "author": null, "date": "Feb 22, 2011", "content": "NEW YORK -- The Jets are raising ticket prices.

The team also said business-side employees are being asked to take one week's unpaid furlough every month if the NFL and its players' union fail to reach a new labor agreement by the March 3 deadline. \"While we have every reason to believe that the season will go on as planned, it makes sense to adjust our policies to reflect that uncertainty around exactly when an agreement will be reached,\" Jets executive vice present of business operations Matt Higgins said.

Right now, I don't have a single offensive tackle among the Top 10 on the Big Board, which could force some teams into the precarious position of reaching a bit if they don't have a trade-down dance partner and feel they really need to address that position.

Phil Dawson, who was expected to become a free agent, will make $3.25 million next season, and it's possible he could still sign a long-term contract with the Browns. He's been trying to get a new deal from the club for several years. But despite being underpaid among his peers -- he made $1 million last season -- Phil Dawson has continued to perform at a high level. He has connected on 252 of 303 career attempts, an 83.2 percentage, ninth-best in NFL history. Last season, the 36-year-old made 23 of 28 field goals and all 28 extra points. Phil Dawson also passed Hall of Famer Lou Groza for the most field goals in team history and joined Groza and Don Cockroft as the only Browns to surpass 1,000 points. Phil Dawson is the first player franchised by the Browns since their return. He was expected to hit the free-agent market in March, and was prepared for it. In fact, he sold his suburban home here, and moved his family back to his native Texas. He left Browns after the season finale thinking he had probably played his last game with the Browns. However, the uncertain labor situation may have changed the landscape for both he and the Browns, who recognize his value. Phil Dawson has been unhappy with the club for not rewarding his consistency and longevity. He skipped the Browns' offseason workouts last season in protest for not getting a new contract. It's not known how he feels about the franchise tag. Phil Dawson did not immediately return a phone message left by The Associated Press.

The mediation is voluntary -- in theory, each side could walk away at any time -- yet it now appears very likely that the current round of talks will stretch through Thursday, which would make for a full week. One indication: The union sent a memo Tuesday to let player agents know that their meeting that was supposed to happen Thursday in Colts is being postponed because of the mediation. Commissioner Roger Goodell, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and members of their bargaining teams met for about eight hours Tuesday at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a U.S. government agency. Among those joining Smith on Tuesday were Bears linebacker Hunter Hillenmeyer, Ravens cornerback Domonique Foxworth and former player Sean Morey. All participants have been abiding by mediator George Cohen's request not to discuss the talks publicly. \"You guys will just speculate too much on whatever I say,\" Hillenmeyer said when he left. Union spokesman George Atallah wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press: \"Every report about what's happening in the room at this point is pure speculation.\" After months of infrequent and sometimes contentious bargaining, the league and union have been communicating face-to-face since Friday. They agreed to try mediation in a bid to find common ground before the current labor deal expires at the end of the day March 3. The union has said it believes team owners want to lock out the players as soon as the next day, which could threaten the 2011 season. One key member of the NFLPA negotiating team, outside counsel Jeffrey Kessler, walked out Tuesday with a rolling suitcase and got into a waiting taxi. He was leaving town ahead of Thursday's hearing in Minneapolis in front of U.S. District Court judge David Doty for the union's appeal of a ruling about whether the NFL improperly negotiated TV contracts. Doty holds jurisdiction over NFL labor matters. \"I've got to focus now on Vikings,\" Kessler said, \"but I'll be back.\" The NFLPA's memo putting off the scheduled meeting with agents at the NFL combine this week in Colts was confirmed by Atallah after being first reported Tuesday by SportsBusiness Journal. The meeting was postponed until Friday. The league and union went more than two months without any formal bargaining until Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once the next week, then called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Among the other significant points in negotiations: a rookie wage scale; the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; and benefits for retired players.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6146778", "Entities": ["Colts", "Bears", "Ravens", "Vikings"]}, {"title": "Scouts Inc.: AFC offseason needs", "author": "Gary Horton", "date": "Feb 22, 2011", "content": "Amid the uncertainty of the NFL labor talks, the possibility of a lockout and no free agency, one thing is certain: There will be an NFL draft in April.

Top needs: 1.\tQuarterback: Ryan Fitzpatrick showed flashes of excellent play, but on a good team he'd be a quality backup. People in the Bills organization feel that he is good enough to win with, but where's the velocity and consistent accuracy? Still, with so many holes to fill on this roster, the coaches may have to live with Ryan Fitzpatrick another year. 2. Left Tackle: Demetrius Bell was adequate in 2010, but the Bills have passed on a lot of premier offensive tackles in recent years, and it has hurt them in pass protection and run-blocking. Could Bell move to right tackle if the Bills could find a fit for the left side? 3. Defensive End: Kyle Williams is the only quality producer on the defensive line, which is especially poor in run defense. Former first-round pick Aaron Maybin looks like a bust as either a rush outside linebacker, if they stay with the 3-4 scheme, or a defensive end if they switch back to the 4-3. Veteran Spencer Johnson is aging, and the Bills could use an infusion of young talent at the position.

So why in the world did he leave the University of North Panthers after a month on the job to join the Cowboys? \"To get yourself promoted in this profession, whether it's college or pro, is to be associated with winning, and I think the Cowboys are ready to do that,\" Baker said. \"Obviously if you win on this stage, that's like winning twice. Everybody sees you because of the visibility of the program. Like I told Butch [Davis],'I like to do it the way you did it.'\" Davis is a former Cowboys defensive line coach who moved up to defensive coordinator only to leave to become a college head coach. This is the method of Baker, who comes from the Panthers and gets high endorsements from former defensive end Julius Peppers for his fine work on the defensive line. Baker brings plenty of energy to a Cowboys defensive line that has some talent in nose tackle Jay Ratliff, and two young players with plenty of upside in Josh Brent and Sean Lissemore. There are three free-agent veteran defensive ends -- Marcus Spears, Jason Hatcher and Stephen Bowen -- whom Baker has to wait on before working with them. Of course, there is another veteran, Igor Olshansky, who performed well in 2010. How Baker improves this unit will be watched closely by people who conduct hiring: athletic directors, university and college presidents, and boosters. If Baker can make Jay Ratliff a better player and get the young kids to make more plays, his stock will rise. After John Fox and his staff were let go in Panthers following the 2010 season, Baker cleaned out his office and within 48 hours was hired by Davis at North Panthers. He worked for a month, doing recruiting, taking the mandatory NCAA test on rules for college coaches, and gaining understanding of the overall system of college life. Then Jason Garrett came calling. Jason Garrett knew of Baker from conversations he'd had with his brother Judd, who works in the Cowboys' pro personnel department, and secondary coach Dave Campo. Jason Garrett respects both men, and when he called Baker, he told him he was waiting on him and him only. \"Really, if it weren't the Cowboys, I probably would not have considered coming back to the NFL,\" Baker said. \"I had some opportunities that I turned down just because I was convinced I wanted to go be a college head coach and I thought the best way to do that was through a college coach.\" Baker acknowledged that it's difficult for minorities to get head-coaching jobs in the NFL and in colleges. There are seven minority head coaches out of 32 teams in the NFL. The college ranks are worse. A recent study from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports at the University of Central Florida stated that out of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams, only 15 are run by people of color. The report said that's a record high number. However, African-Americans make up 51.3 percent of the players in the FBS. Baker knows the challenges of getting a head-coaching job are great, which is why the NFL instituted the Rooney Rule, which mandates that teams interview minority candidates for head-coaching and some high-level front-office positions. Yet, he is undeterred and knows his work on the field will tell everybody more about him than anything else. But to get to the college gig, he stresses, winning at the pro level will help. \"This situation probably could not have worked out better for me,\" he said. \"It gave me an opportunity to sincerely go and recruit hard for a month. I got a chance to recruit guys, took the NCAA test, I did all those things and I got a chance to feel the changes [in college football].\" Now to the mail. Q: I've heard that O.J. Atogwe is doing the rounds. I haven't heard anything about the Cowboys' interest. With an obvious need at the position, do the Cowboys go after him? -- Cedric (Arlington, Texas) A: According to a team official, the Cowboys have no plans to bring in O.J. Atogwe. Team officials like O.J. Atogwe but are planning a wait-and-see attitude with free agents for numerous reasons, including the uncertainty of the collective bargaining agreement and the possibility that an impact safety can be picked up in the draft. O.J. Atogwe also might command a high salary, $5 million to $6 million per year on average, and that might be too much for the Cowboys to pay. Q: Hey Cal, honestly the Cowboys have a deadly offense already. However, they should look into a younger quarterback (Colin Kaepernick) to back up Tony Romo and possibly take over if needed. Jon Kitna is old and I'm not sold on Stephen McGee. Adding another receiver in case Roy Williams doesn't show up won't hurt either. -- David Laws (Columbia, S.C.) A: There is nothing wrong with drafting a quarterback. Jon Kitna is getting older, and he's in the final year of his contract. And while McGee did have flashes, there still is more work that needs to be done. Now let's look at Tony Romo. He's signed through the 2013 season, when he'll be 33. He's still among the top 10 quarterbacks in the game, but when he gets to 2013, will younger quarterbacks Sam Bradford, Matt Ryan, Joe Flacco and Mark Sanchez have surpassed him? Maybe. Will Tony Romo have won a title by then? Maybe. Either way, Tony Romo is still young enough that the Cowboys don't have to worry about him right now. Q: Cam Newton! That's a big boy. Why aren't we talking about getting him and why don't we want him? -- Roy Hinojos Jr. (Ontario, Calif.) A: If Cam Newton is available at number 9, which I doubt will happen, should the Cowboys draft him? Yes. But Cam Newton will be gone by the fourth pick. Q: I would like to know if they cut a player before the CBA ends, does that player count toward the new cap or is he part of the last year with no cap? -- Carlos Strand (Miles Austin, Texas) A: There are many unanswered questions when it comes to the salary cap and the prorated money teams count against the salary cap. We think the cap will return and be more than it was in 2009. If that's the case, do the Cowboys want to cut players and have some players' money count against the cap for the next two or three seasons? When the new CBA is finalized, there will be answers to these questions. Right now, things are uncertain. Q: I'm just curious as to why you guys think there is so much hype about Dez Bryant being the Cowboys' best receiver. I believe that Miles Austin is. I don't want to take anything from Dez, but just last year we were saying that Miles was possibly the best WR in the game. Is it just the drops Miles Austin had this past season or is there something I am missing about Dez? -- Randy (Wichita, Kan.) A: I don't know who you talked to, Randy, but there are few people, if any, who said Miles Austin was one of the best wide receivers in the game. Miles Austin is a talented receiver with speed, good hands (I know he had 10 drops last season) and excellent route-running abilities. But Dez Bryant is a wonderful talent who possesses outstanding skills to become an elite receiver quicker than Miles Austin. The Cowboys did the right thing to draft Dez Bryant because if you have a chance to draft an elite player, you need to do it. With the ninth pick of the draft this year, the Cowboys will get an elite player again.

Actually, to me as a normal everyday fan, what happens off the actual gridiron kind of bores me. I see it as none of my business, what the dollar amount a player makes or a coach is getting or how much an owner had to pay to keep up a stadium. That is their deal. I just want my teams to rock come game time. However, I do get the fact that if my team makes smart and fiscally prudent moves, we will have extra dough to get a free agent somewhere out there who might fill some gap that will make us better on paper at least. So, in saying all of that, I do get that it is a business, and one that is not unlike my profession. In my careers with Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, I have found that oftentimes I deal with some of the same issues as a pro athlete. 1) Your \"earning years\" are somewhat limited. 2) Although you may be at a venue to \"play with heart,\" your real purpose to those who run the venues is to sell parking, beer, T-shirts, sundry concessions and otherwise put warm bodies into those varyingly priced seats. 3) number 2 may sound a bit harsh; but the people who actually run things are the guys in suits. It's all about the bottom line. From what I can glean, the biggest issue of this recent CBA is the fact that, with the $9 billion of revenues that the NFL has earned, the owners currently have rights to $1 billion to use for stadium upkeep/improvements. The owners now, however, would like to hike that amount to $2 billion. The NFL Players Association seems to understand that certain expenses must be paid-out to keep the game, as a whole, relevant and pristine. But herein lies one of the rubs in the negotiation: The players want to first have the owners open up their books so the NFLPA can verify just exactly what all of those expenses are for, and where they are going. That seems logical, right? Ah, but apparently the owners will not cough up the ledgers. This seems asinine to me. If I were a player, that point alone would be a deal-breaker. The NFLPA, on the other hand, is willing to make some concessions but in return is asking for a fund in the area of $100 million to be used for retired players' care, for injuries and whatnot sustained during their playing days. It's for the older dudes who are now crippled because of their bodily sacrifice on the field. We fans outside of the game may scoff at the fact that a player would ever be in need of dough. If you've played in the NFL, we think you must be set for life financially, right? I mean, a player who plays just three years probably makes more in those three years than a normal hard-working American makes in 25 years. Yeah, but check this out. If you are a young man entering the NFL, and you are guaranteed say, $2 million to play for the next three years, does that mean that you know how to instantly handle that cash? First off, your agent takes 3-10 percent, so now you are down to $1.8 million. Oh, and then the tax man takes his 37 percent, so you are down to a little more than $1 million even without other payments, such as lawyer fees. The player at this point probably has some friends and family who he wants to take care of, and maybe he wants to buy a house and a car. Rarely do these guys think that their career is going to be short-lived, and they might even think that there is going to be a lot more cash coming when a new contract comes. I mean, these are top athletes and they are programmed to think in terms of success, not failure. More than likely, a young man programmed to think like this will just go ahead and spend what is left of this first windfall. And then a career-ending injury happens, or some such other event that shortens or ends his career. Suddenly, all of that money is gone. In a flash. I've seen it happen to guys in the music industry, too. They just think the money train is an endless ride. It ain't. In the case of the NFL, though, I have this sneaking suspicion that, in the end, this stuff will all get worked out before next season. It will wait until August or so -- just late enough that all of us fans start to get nervous and really jonesing for pro football. The owners will get what they want. The players will get what they want (I hope). And us fans? Oh, you just know that we will end up paying more for our seats, our parking and our drinks, hats and jerseys. Yeah, we love this game!

He departs for the Colts-based NFL combine on Friday and is scheduled to go through a four-day job interview -- filled with poking and prodding -- that is unlike most others. It will start with a hospital visit and medical evaluations. He'll meet with various NFL teams. There will be media interviews and then, on the final day, the physical testing. That's what Herzlich and the other 328 invited prospects have been preparing for in recent weeks. Herzlich has been training in Bradenton, Fla., with 20 others -- a group including BC offensive lineman Anthony Castonzo -- and he is expecting a \"mental drain.\" \"It's a business right now, so you're going to do your job,\" he said Tuesday after his morning workout. \"I want to leave there with no regrets that I could have left something on the table. I don't expect that to happen. I feel confident.\" Herzlich figures to be scrutinized closely by NFL teams from a medical and performance standpoint. He is currently rated as a late fifth-round draft choice by ESPN's Scouts Inc, although that could change with a strong showing at the combine, specifically with a good time in the 40-yard dash. Herzlich, who is represented by agent Tom Condon, hasn't been paying attention to where he's ranked by analysts. \"I have no idea.

Wherever I go is wherever I go.\" To prepare for the combine, Herzlich has been in Bradenton, where the wake-up call comes at 6:15. The mornings have consisted of speed and agility work, as well as position-specific drills with coaches. The afternoons include weightlifting, mental conditioning and vision training. It's a full day, with the prospects finishing with dinner at 6 p.m. It's all designed so Herzlich will be at his best at the combine, which he had heard plenty about from former BC teammates B.J. Raji and Mike McLaughlin. \"I think it's important,\" Herzlich said of the combine. \"I think it does a lot to help if you do really well. At the same time, I think a lot of coaches understand it's not football, so if you're a good football player, you should be fine.\" Physical tests aside, Herzlich views himself as a versatile player who fits in both 3-4 and 4-3 defenses at various spots. He is considered to have NFL-type size at 6-foot-4 and 245 pounds, and strong intangibles that include his ability to manage a game and leadership. If there is one area that scouts figure to watch closest after his performance in January's Senior Bowl, it will be how well Herzlich runs. On Monday, Herzlich said he had a standard doctor's appointment in Tampa to confirm what he already knew since returning in 2010 after being diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma (a form of cancer that can attack bones) and having a rod inserted in his left leg (femur). \"My health is fine, just like anybody else's,\" he said. \"I got all green lights and don't have any worries.\" Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPNBoston.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/news/story?id=6149750", "Entities": ["Colts", "Anthony Castonzo", "B.J.

Jeremy Shockey was released Tuesday by the Saints, who appear ready to move on with promising second-year pro and 2010 third-round draft choice Jimmy Graham. \"It's a business, I understand,\" Jeremy Shockey told ESPN's Rachel Nichols. \"I'll just go play hard for someone else. Whoever gets me it's going to be a steal.\" Jeremy Shockey was no stranger to the Big Easy social scene and also helped give the city a reason to celebrate like never before. He made a crucial touchdown catch in the fourth quarter of the Saints' lone Super Bowl victory over Colts in Dolphins just more than a year ago. But with one season and $4.2 million in base salary left on Jeremy Shockey's contract, the Saints decided the best way to pursue a second championship would be without the 30-year-old, nine-year veteran. \"Jeremy played an important role in helping our team bring a Super Bowl championship to Saints,\" coach Sean Payton said. \"He contributed to the success of our offense, both as a pass-catcher and run blocker, and we're appreciative of his efforts.\" Acquired from the Giants in a trade at the onset of 2008 training camp, Jeremy Shockey spent three up-and-down seasons in Saints and labored through injuries in all of them. Last season, Jeremy Shockey made 41 catches for 408 yards and three touchdowns in 13 games. Jeremy Shockey's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, did not answer his phone, but Jeremy Shockey posted a note on his Twitter page: \"Always will remember my time in Saints. What a city, you all welcomed me like one of your own, and we had a great run. Onto the next chapter, the Deep Unknown.\" Jeremy Shockey, a former Dolphins Hurricanes star who makes his offseason home in Dolphins's South Beach, is an adventure traveler and avid free diver. While he played for the Giants, who made him a first-round draft pick in 2002, he was popular and productive, but also seen as a malcontent and a distraction by the time his stay in New York had ended. In Saints, he rejoined Sean Payton, who had been his offensive coordinator in New York during his rookie season, which remains one of his best seasons statistically, with 74 catches for 894 yards and two TDs. After Jeremy Shockey arrived in Saints, he often sidestepped reporters and for the most part avoided generating negative headlines. Not entirely, though. In 2008, he was critical of the team's handling of his sports hernia injury, which he contended was misdiagnosed. Off the field, he made news for being hospitalized after passing out because of dehydration at a pool-side party in Las Vegas in the summer of 2009. As he looks for a new team, Jeremy Shockey's resume includes 510 catches for 5,688 yards and 33 TDs in his nine-season career. The questions now are how many good seasons he has left and which teams want to take a chance on him. In his three seasons in Saints, he caught 139 passes for 1,460 yards with six touchdowns in 38 regular season games, 34 of them starts. Last season, Jeremy Shockey made an effort to serve as a mentor for Jimmy Graham, who also attended Dolphins, but entered college as a basketball player before a lone season of football with the'Canes. Jimmy Graham improved steadily as the season wore on and became a trusted target for quarterback Drew Brees, who raved about his rapid development. Jimmy Graham finished his rookie season with 31 catches for 356 yards and five touchdowns, with one play going for 52 yards. Jimmy Graham routinely credited Jeremy Shockey for teaching him the NFL game and Saints officials said they appreciated not just Jeremy Shockey's effort on game days, but his willingness to hasten the development of his understudy. \"I'd like to thank Jeremy for the contributions he made to our team,\" general manager Mickey Loomis said. \"These decisions are never easy to make and we wish him the best.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6148294", "Entities": ["Jeremy Shockey", "Saints", "Jimmy Graham", "Colts", "Dolphins", "Sean Payton", "Giants", "Drew Brees"]}, {"title": "Top-tier tight ends scarce in 2011", "author": "Kevin Weidl", "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "content": "The 2011 tight end class is not as strong those of as recent years from a talent standpoint, and lacks top-tier prospects like Jermaine Gresham and Rob Gronkowski last year.

LaMarr Woodley becomes the first player to sign a franchise tender. The players' union has questioned the validity of franchise and transition tags with the current collective bargaining agreement set to expire at the end of the day on March 3. A league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter on Tuesday that Panthers center Ryan Kalil, who also received a franchise tag, plans to sign his tender as well. In the final season of his rookie contract, LaMarr Woodley, 26, made $550,000. But next season, he'll stand to make more than $10 million because of the tag and his position. The Steelers could also sign him to a long-term contract. LaMarr Woodley, 26, who just finished his third season with Steelers, had 50 tackles, 10 sacks and two interceptions last season, helping the Steelers to the AFC championship. The former second-round pick out of Michigan has 39 sacks and seven forced fumbles for his career. In the Steelers' three-game playoff run, LaMarr Woodley had 10 tackles and three sacks. A member of the 2010 AFC Pro Bowl squad, LaMarr Woodley is the only player in NFL history to post at least one sack in six consecutive postseason games.

He dreamed about jetting across the country to be wooed and wowed. In the end, though, the perennial Pro Bowl cornerback excused the Broncos for pulling a four-year contract offer off the table back in October and decided to stay in Broncos even though he might have made more money on the open market. \"One thing I've learned, the grass ain't always greener,\" Champ Bailey said Tuesday after signing a four-year deal with Broncos. \"I could go to an organization that looks like they're ready and then they're not ready and then I'm miserable because I'm around a lot of unfamiliar faces and in an unfamiliar place. \"I thought about that and I thought about being on the market. But all in all, it didn't really take me to forgive them. There's new people in charge up there. I know that I could have gotten something worked out. Once Josh McDaniels left, things did work out, didn't it?\" Champ Bailey's four-year deal effectively makes him the second highest paid cornerback in football behind only Darrelle Revis of the Jets, a source told ESPN's senior NFL writer John Clayton. The source indicated Champ Bailey signed a four-year deal that could be worth between $43 million and $47 million. The contract has $22 million of guarantees. In the first year of the contract, Champ Bailey will make $15 million, which equates to the franchise number for a cornerback in 2011. Over the first two years of the contract, he will make $22 million, the source said. One reason Champ Bailey didn't test free agency, he said, was the league's labor uncertainty. The sides are meeting in Redskins, D.C., under federal mediation in a bid to find common ground before the current labor deal expires at the end of the day March 3. The union has said it believes team owners want to lock out the players as soon as the next day, which could threaten the 2011 season. \"There is no certainty once March 4 rolls around,\" Champ Bailey said. \"That played a role in my decision, to make sure something got done. I don't know what's going to happen after March 3, because of the CBA and all of that stuff. You don't know how teams are going to react to free agents and what's going to be out there. I just figured if I can, get it done. \"But, it's really what I wanted all along anyway.\" Champ Bailey remains one of the league's premiere shutdown cornerbacks even at age 32. He just played in his 10th Pro Bowl, a record for cornerbacks, but the one big void in his career is a trip to the Super Bowl. \"When you talk about awards, things you can take home to remember your career, the ring is the most important thing,\" Champ Bailey said on a conference call with media that cover the Broncos. \"I want to get that ring, and I want to do it here.\" Champ Bailey, who has only been to the playoffs three times in his 12 NFL seasons, said he thinks the Broncos are in capable hands under new coach John Fox, who has deep defensive roots, and can quickly halt a five-year playoff drought. \"The talent and leadership that Champ Bailey brings to the Broncos made it very important for us to keep him with the organization,\" John Fox said in a statement. \"I have admired him for a long time and I really look forward to having him on our team.\" \"It may sound stupid, but in a few years, hopefully you guys will look back and say,'Well, Champ said they could turn around pretty quick,' \" Champ Bailey said. \"So hopefully this thing will get turned around a lot faster than we all expect.\" Champ Bailey and pass-rusher Elvis Dumervil, who missed last season with a torn chest muscle a year after leading the NFL with 17 sacks in 2009, are now the cornerstones of Broncos's massive defensive makeover. \"Champ is truly one of the NFL's elite players, a 10-time Pro Bowler who is playing at the absolute highest level,\" Broncos football chief John Elway wrote on Twitter. \"The commitment and loyalty that Champ has shown to the Broncos, the city of Broncos and this region is exemplary. We're fortunate to have Champ with the Broncos for a long time. This is a GREAT day for our entire organization and our fans.\" Even though most teams only throw his way a couple times a game, Champ Bailey's 48 career interceptions rank first among cornerbacks since he entered the league as the seventh overall pick by the Redskins in 2009 and his 183 pass breakups are tops among players during the past 12 years. \"Signing Champ was a top priority this offseason,\" general manager Brian Xanders said in a statement. \"He has shown incredible loyalty to the Broncos organization and this community in his seven seasons with the club. His value on and off the field is immeasurable, and we couldn't be happier that he is positioned to finish his Hall of Fame career as a Bronco.\" Champ Bailey said he appreciated Elway's involvement in re-signing him and also the Broncos' willingness to extend an offer to him just four months shy of his 33rd birthday. \"It means a lot, because you don't see it happen very often. But I've got to be honest, not to sound arrogant or anything, but I don't come along very often, either.... And I appreciate the fact that they realize that and they realize how important it was for me to stay here.\" It had started to look as if the Broncos would lose Champ Bailey this offseason. Even when they reopened talks with his representatives earlier this month, Champ Bailey decided to try to sell his Littleton home that he bought for $1.6 million a few years ago. \"Well, you know what, everything that you say publicly has something to do with negotiations,\" Champ Bailey acknowledged. \"It always does. Jay Cutler putting his house up a few years ago. I mean, c'mon. It all has something to do with negotiations.\" Champ Bailey would still like to sell his house. Maybe he's intent on downsizing because when he was asked if he'd be interested in upgrading to the mansion of NBA star Carmelo Anthony, who was traded from the Broncos Nuggets to the New York Knicks in a blockbuster trade Tuesday, he said no way. \"Oh, no. That's too much. I've been in that house,\" Champ Bailey said. \"Oh no, that's too much.\" Champ Bailey's deal was welcome news in a city that was hit hard by the departures of Anthony and homegrown star Chauncey Billups, which followed the recent retirement of hockey great Peter Forsberg after a short-lived comeback attempt with the Colorado Avalanche. Champ Bailey said deep down he never wanted to leave Broncos. \"I feel like I'm a Broncos native. I'm not from here, but it feels good here. I feel like I'm home. That played a big part in my decision to stay, because I want to help make this city proud,\" he said. \"It's been a while. I don't think we've done anything good since the [2005 AFC] championship game. The fans deserve it, and I want to be a part of making it happen for them.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6148575", "Entities": ["Champ Bailey", "Broncos", "Josh McDaniels", "Darrelle Revis", "Jets", "Redskins", "John Fox", "Elvis Dumervil", "Jay Cutler"]}, {"title": "NFL calls special meeting", "author": "Adam Schefter", "date": "Feb 23, 2011", "content": "The NFL has called a special meeting Thursday, on the first day of the combine in Colts, for all NFL general managers and head coaches. Three members per team are being told to attend -- general manager, coach and another high-ranking team official, league sources said. At the meeting, the NFL is expected to brief teams on any number of issues pertaining to labor uncertainty and football operations, including what to expect in the days leading up to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the manner of league business that will be allowed this offseason, and the type of contact that teams will be permitted to have with agents. The meeting is expected to be held at 5:30 p.m. ET Thursday.

It's not the first time.\" After months of infrequent and sometimes contentious bargaining, the league and union have been communicating face to face in Redskins since Friday with the help of mediator George Cohen. The sides talked for the sixth straight day Wednesday, with Broncos cornerback Brian Dawkins, Colts center Jeff Saturday and Chiefs linebacker Mike Vrabel and guard Brian Waters in attendance, along with former player Sean Morey. They joined commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and their respective negotiating teams for the talks that consumed 35 hours in the first five days. All participants have been abiding by Cohen's request not to discuss the talks publicly, and few hints of progress -- or lack thereof -- have been evident from either side. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to try mediation in a bid to find common ground before the current labor deal expires at the end of the day March 3. The union has said it believes team owners want to lock out the players as soon as the next day, which could threaten the 2011 season. The mediation is voluntary -- in theory, each side could walk away at any time -- yet it now appears likely that the current round of talks will stretch through Thursday, which would make for a full week.

It's going to take a little while longer to figure out how to do it effectively. Committee members spent most of Thursday afternoon meeting in Colts, site of the league's annual scouting combine, and discussed everything from player safety to what constitutes a catch. No formal proposals have been made, and none may be forthcoming until the committee's next scheduled meeting in Florida. Clearly, though, protecting players is among the hottest topics on the league's agenda -- after collective bargaining agreement negotiations. \"Every year different tactics come into the game, and guys are taught different ways to play the game,\" said Falcons president Rich McKay, the longtime co-chair of the committee. \"When that happens, I think we have to talk about how we deal with that. Do we have a proposal? Not yet. Do I anticipate one? I sure do.\" McKay wouldn't speculate on possible changes, but his comments came about 12 hours after the league said it would unveil a revised sideline protocol for concussion testing on Friday. After the full committee broke late Wednesday, McKay returned about an hour later to meet with the coaches' subcommittee. Attendees included Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, Eagles coach Andy Reid, Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo, Ravens coach John Harbaugh and Browns president Mike Holmgren. Mike Tomlin, Marvin Lewis and Steve Spagnuolo all declined to comment on the discussions following a nearly three-hour session. McKay said the number 1 topic during that portion was player fines, though he heard no complaints from coaches -- even those who had players openly critical of the league's increased fines for hits to the head last season. \"They wanted a discussion and an understanding of the fine system itself and how it all operates,\" McKay told The Associated Press. \"I've been one who individually believes that the fine system works pretty well for us. It's intended to deter conduct, and I think when you look at the number of repeat offenders we have, it works pretty well for us.\" Another topic under review is what constitutes a catch. The national debate over that rule began in September, when Lions receiver Calvin Johnson leaped for a catch and got two feet and a knee in the end zone before the football hit the ground and he let it go. It was ruled incomplete, The play could have been a game-winner. Instead, Lions lost 19-14. \"Quite frankly, it's something we've talked about the last couple of years and there's an inherent conflict between slow motion replay, super slow motion replay and what we ask our officials to do on the field,\" McKay said. \"So we need to write the rule in a way as to not put our officials in a bad position.\" Colts President Bill Polian, also a longtime committee member, cautioned against reading too much into Wednesday's discussions. But those discussions will likely set the agenda for what changes the committee wants to address before the 2011 season. \"It sounds corny, but I've always said that I don't think we should never have anything that's not on the table,\" McKay said. On Thursday, head coaches and team general managers are scheduled to meet with the NFL's management council. Most believe they will get an update on how negotiations are proceeding, but four coaches declined to comment on the meeting, as did Polian and McKay.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6152785", "Entities": ["Colts", "Falcons", "Steelers", "Mike Tomlin", "Bengals", "Marvin Lewis", "Eagles", "Andy Reid", "Rams", "Steve Spagnuolo", "Ravens", "John Harbaugh", "Browns", "Lions", "Calvin Johnson"]}, {"title": "Colts, Peyton Manning working on deal", "author": null, "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Bill Polian says negotiations between the Colts and Peyton Manning are progressing. Just don't expect the two sides to cut a deal this weekend. \"I would say we are simply moving ahead at a steady pace, but nothing is imminent,\" the Colts' president told The Associated Press after meeting with the NFL's competition committee Wednesday. The competition committee is meeting in Colts as part of the NFL scouting combine, which opens Thursday. Peyton Manning's deal is the Colts' top offseason priority. Team owner Jim Irsay said last week he had already offered Peyton Manning a deal that would eclipse Tom Brady's record for annual average salary. Irsay did not provide additional details of the proposal, though he acknowledged Peyton Manning's next contract cold be for five or six years. Tom Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract in September, giving him a league record $18 million average salary. Indy is already hedging its bets, too. Last week, it put the exclusive franchise tag on the only four-time MVP in league history, keeping him off the free-agent market. Under current rules, Peyton Manning could not negotiate with another team, and if he plays under the tag he will make about $23 million next season. The Colts did the same thing in 2004 when they signed Peyton Manning to a seven-year, $98 million. They later rescinded the franchise tag. Polian hopes something can be worked out before the league's collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the day on March 3. Peyton Manning's deal would have the biggest impact under a new salary cap -- if there is one in the next CBA. But Peyton Manning's not the only player the Colts are trying to re-sign. Indy's list of potential free agents includes Adam Vinatieri, the best clutch kicker in NFL history; running back Joseph Addai, their starter and best blocking back; Charlie Johnson, Peyton Manning's blind-side protector; Melvin Bullitt, who would likely move into the starting lineup now that the Colts have released safety Bob Sanders; starting linebacker Clint Session and starting defensive tackle Dan Muir. Negotiations have also begun with Adam Vinatieri, Irsay said last week, and Polian said the Colts are pressing ahead with all those negotiations. \"We're presuming it's business as usual, and if that changes, we have a plan,\" he said. The Colts are certainly not standing pat after winning an eighth AFC South title in nine years. Coach Jim Caldwell also has hired two new coaches and reassigned three holdovers. In addition to putting the franchise tag on Peyton Manning, the Colts claimed defensive tackle DeMario Pressley off waivers from Texans on Tuesday and they released Sanders, the 2007 NFL defensive player of the year, last week. Sanders had played in only nine regular-season games since signing a five-year, $37.5 million deal after the 2007 season. While it's unlikely Sanders will be back in a Colts uniform next season, Polian said Indy would be willing to bring him back if he does not sign with another team. \"I don't know if I'd categorize it as a chance,\" Polian said. \"It would be nice to have him back, I can tell you that.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6152114", "Entities": ["Colts", "Peyton Manning", "Tom Brady", "Adam Vinatieri", "Joseph Addai", "Charlie Johnson", "Jim Caldwell", "Texans"]}, {"title": "Day 6 of labor mediation finishes", "author": null, "date": "Feb 23, 2011", "content": "WASHINGTON -- The NFL and the players' union wrapped up a sixth consecutive day of mediated talks Wednesday -- and they will meet again Thursday. NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and most of his negotiating group -- including four current players -- left Wednesday's session at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service a little after 5:30 p.m. That was less than an hour after Smith and a dozen members of the union's team returned from a 1\u00bd-hour break. It wasn't clear what, if any, significance the break holds, although it was the first time since the mediation began Friday that either side left the building en masse in the middle of a day. Generally, the groups have arrived in the morning and departed in the evening. They've met for a total of more than 40 hours so far. Smith and others in the union contingent declined to comment, abiding by mediator George Cohen's request that the sides stay silent. Nothing about what's been discussed has been revealed by either side. \"I just can't say anything. I'm afraid of Mr. Cohen,\" NFL lead negotiator Jeff Pash said when he left, about an hour after Smith did. \"I'm going to just say,'No comment.' See you tomorrow morning.\" The current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the day March 3, and the voluntary mediation is seen as an attempt to spur progress. NFLPA executive committee members Brian Dawkins of the Broncos, Jeff Saturday of the Colts, and Mike Vrabel and Brian Waters of the Chiefs participated Wednesday. Nine of that committee's 11 members have been present at some point during these six days of talks; union president Kevin Mawae and Saints quarterback Drew Brees have not been seen entering or exiting the meetings. On Thursday, the league will hold a meeting for general managers, coaches and other officials at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Colts. \"It's a normal part of the combine, which is always filled with meetings galore,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press after ESPN.com first reported about the GMs-coaches session. \"There was such a meeting last year. It's not the first time.\" Still, given the state of labor negotiations, the NFL is expected to update attendees -- although Commissioner Roger Goodell and Pash would be in Redskins, not Colts, on Thursday. There will be another development Thursday: A U.S. District Court judge in Vikings will hold a hearing on the union's appeal of this month's ruling on its complaint about the league's TV contracts. The union has accused the NFL of structuring TV contracts so owners would be guaranteed money even if there were a lockout in 2011 -- while not getting the most revenue possible in other seasons, when income would need to be shared with players. After months of infrequent and sometimes contentious bargaining, the league and union have been communicating face-to-face since Friday. The league and union went more than two months without any formal bargaining until Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once the next week, then called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. The biggest issue separating the sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Among the other significant points in negotiations: a rookie wage scale; the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; and benefits for retired players.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6150498", "Entities": ["Brian Dawkins", "Broncos", "Jeff Saturday", "Colts", "Mike Vrabel", "Brian Waters", "Chiefs", "Saints", "Drew Brees", "Redskins", "Vikings"]}, {"title": "Mark Ingram clearly the top RB", "author": "Todd McShay", "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "content": "Alabama's Mark Ingram is the only legitimate first-round running back prospect in the 2011 NFL draft, and even he has some detractors who point to durability issues and lack of top-notch acceleration as buyer-beware signs.

Commissioner Roger Goodell scheduled a Thursday meeting to update owners, general managers and head coaches on their seven-day mediation session with the NFL Players Association. On Friday, player agents, who normally work on potential free-agent deals, will be briefed by NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Alex Torrey Smith on the same subject. The focus of this pro football convention is supposed to be in Lucas Oil Stadium, site of Super Bowl XLVI and where 329 draft prospects work out, but coaches and general managers will be distracted, trying to figure out whether the owners will lock out the players on March 3. Here are the 10 things to look for at this year's combine: 1. Labor: Sources indicate that the seven days of federal mediation were productive but that no new CBA is expected to be agreed upon at this time. Owners haven't adjusted their position that they need another billion dollars of credits taken off the top of the revenue that already removes $1 billion from the percentage available to the players. Whether that would drop player costs to 42 or 46 percent of all revenue is a point for debate. What needs to be clarified in the next week is whether owners feel good enough about the seven days of mediation that they might delay a lockout of players, declare an impasse and operate under their last offer or whether they might simply lock out the players. Owners meet next week in Redskins, D.C., to make their final decisions on the short-term future of the league. 2. Free agency: It won't start until there is a new CBA, but general managers have until next week to re-sign their own free agents. Franchise and transition tags, along with the re-signings of cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Ronde Barber, have whittled the list of unsigned potential free agents to 470, but key decisions have to be made. Do the Seahawks re-sign quarterback Matt Hasselbeck before March 4? Are the 49ers serious about bringing back quarterback Alex Torrey Smith to compete for a starting job for new coach Jim Harbaugh? Can the Raiders prevent cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha from hitting the market? 3. Quarterbacks' throwing session Sunday: Auburn's Cam Newton has the most to gain by deciding to do all the drills and make all the throws Sunday when 18 draftable quarterbacks head out to the turf in Lucas Oil Stadium. Cam Newton calls himself an entertainer. A great workout, though, could catch the eyes of the Panthers and Bills, who have the first and third picks in the draft. Cam Newton put on a show all season in destroying SEC defenses. Nine teams in the top 16 of the draft could be looking at quarterbacks -- Panthers, Bills, Cardinals, 49ers, Titans, Redskins, Vikings, Dolphins and Jaguars. Cam Newton has to show he's not just a thrower who could become a quarterback bust like JaMarcus Russell. University of Redskins quarterback Jake Locker will try to atone for a subpar Senior Bowl week by throwing and running. Colin Kaepernick of Nevada, Andy Dalton of TCU and Ryan Mallett of Arkansas also are expected to throw. Blaine Gabbert of Missouri is going to run only, saving his throwing session for March 17. Christian Ponder of Florida State also is expected to skip the throwing drills Sunday. 4. Interviews are just as important as the workouts: The draft positions of Cam Newton and Mallett could be determined by how well they do in interview sessions with teams. Cam Newton has to make interested teams feel as if his shaky past before arriving at Auburn isn't a cause for concern if those teams are going to make him their franchise quarterback. He'll have to make teams feel comfortable that his father, who reportedly put a price tag on where Cam Newton was heading to college, won't be a negative influence on him. Mallett will have to silence worries about his off-the-field habits. Mallett has Joe Flacco -type throwing ability, but teams worry that he might be another Ryan Leaf. 5. Don't pull a Michael Crabtree or a Dez Bryant : In the past two combines, Dez Bryant and Michael Crabtree were considered the top receivers in their respective classes, but their poor combine presentations caused them to drop in the first round. In 2009, Michael Crabtree bungled information about a stress fracture. Like Michael Crabtree, Dez Bryant was a top-5 caliber talent whose stock dropped because he didn't come across as mature and responsible in how he handled the 2010 combine. He didn't do a good job of explaining his 2009 suspension at Oklahoma State. In this combine, A.J. Green of Georgia and Julio Jones of Alabama are big, physical receivers considered to be the prize receivers in this draft. Jonathan Baldwin of Pitt -- another tall receiver with 4.4 speed -- could push into the first round with a great workout and interviews. 6. Putting on a show for the NFL Network: Scouts and general managers groused for years about thoughts of televising the scouting combine workouts. Why pay millions of dollars to set up this draft convention and then give up all the information on television, they grumbled. As it turns out, televising the combine has prompted more players to work out, making the jobs easier for scouts not having to fly to schools to get 40 times. As late as 2003, 98 of the 307 invited players didn't work out. The influence of television has cut that number of non-workouts to between 45 and 59 in years since then. The competitive aspect of the running and jumping drills has turned the combine into one of the most watched track meets on television. 7. Getting to know the underclassmen: Despite the labor uncertainties, a record 56 underclassmen declared for the 2011 draft. Defensive tackle Nick Fairley of Auburn, defensive end Da'Quan Bowers of Clemson, cornerback Patrick Peterson of LSU and wide receiver A.J. Green of Georgia head a list of 20-to-25 potential first-round underclassmen whom general managers and coaches have to get to know. 8. Expect more from less at running back: It appears to be a down year at running back with Mark Ingram of Alabama and Mikel Leshoure of Illinois being the only sure first-round running backs. But you would have to think their power running styles would make more impact than a 2010 class that featured three first-round selections \u2013 the Bills' C.J. Spiller, Chargers' Ryan Mathews, and Lions' Jahvid Best -- who were outperformed by undrafted backs LeGarrette Blount and Chris Ivory. 9. Back-to-back defensive line drafts: The 2010 draft featured nine first-round defensive ends or defensive tackles with Ndamukong Suh and Gerald McCoy going number 2 and number 3, respectively, behind quarterback Sam Bradford. Scouts are looking at potentially the same number of first-round defensive linemen, but the talent seems to be more at end. Bowers of Clemson, Robert Quinn of North Panthers, Cameron Jordan of California and Adrian Clayborn of Iowa are considered the top defensive ends, and Nick Fairley of Auburn and Marcell Dareus of Alabama are expected to be the top tackles. 10. Who could light up the stopwatches? Cornerback Patrick Peterson of LSU could move to the top of the draft if he decides to run. He had a hand-held 4.2 40 in spring conditioning drills at LSU. Wide receivers Titus Young of Boise State and wide receiver Torrey Alex Torrey Smith of Maryland could push into the first round if they run in the 4.3 range.

From a Patriots perspective, what are the biggest storylines and areas to monitor? Possible insight into Logan Mankins' mindset. The Patriots' top offensive lineman has been assigned the franchise tag, and three players in a similar situation -- Steelers linebacker LaMarr Woodley, Panthers center Ryan Kalil and Jets linebacker David Harris -- have said they plan to sign their franchise tender. Gathering information on juniors. Throughout the 2010 season, NFL teams focused on seniors who would be entering the draft. This is their chance to get caught up on juniors, which highlights the importance of the interview process at the combine. A player such as linebacker Jerod Mayo is a good example of someone who started to show up on the Patriots' radar more at this point of the process, as he entered the draft following his junior season at Titans. Based on need, one player of note who potentially fits into that category this year is Illinois defensive lineman Corey Liuget, who is projected as a first-round pick. Getting a better read on medical risks. Arguably the most important part of the combine for all NFL teams is having doctors on hand to conduct thorough medical evaluations. Thomas Gill, the Patriots' team doctor, arrived in Colts on Wednesday evening, and his role in the process is a huge part of the value the Patriots will get out of the next week. The Patriots scored big-time in this area with tight end Rob Gronkowski last year, as he had missed his final season at Cardinals with a back injury. From a local perspective, this figures to be a significant part of Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich's week at the combine. Which pass rusher fits best? Draft analysts agree that this is one of the deepest classes of defensive ends in recent memory, with the possibility that eight or nine could be selected within the first 32 picks. Not all ends fit in every system, so given the Patriots' system-specific approach to scouting, who fits best for them as a conversion-type 3-4 outside linebacker? Evaluating players such as North Panthers's Robert Quinn, Purdue's Ryan Kerrigan, UCLA's Akeem Ayers, Missouri's Aldon Smith, Georgia's Justin Texans, Fresno State's Chris Carter, Texas' Sam Acho and Cardinals's Brooks Reed will move the team closer to an answer if they go in that direction in the early rounds. Pair of Cam's on the radar. When it comes to Cal's Cameron Jordan and Ohio State's Cameron Heyward, it might best be summed up this way: Same first name, different games. Still, both could be first-round fits for a Patriots team that could benefit from adding a blue-chip talent to its defensive line. Cameron Jordan has been rising since a strong Senior Bowl performance, while Cameron Heyward's impact was evident in his Buckeye Bowl game finale. Wisconsin's J.J. Watt joins both Cameron Jordan and Cameron Heyward as strong first-round candidates for the Patriots as a 3-4 defensive end, if available. Teams briefed on uncertain labor forecast. Although the primary focus of the combine is to gather information on prospects, the dark cloud hanging over Colts is tied to the NFL's uncertain labor forecast. If the collective bargaining agreement is not extended by March 4, there is a possibility of a lockout. Teams are scheduled to be briefed by the league on rules should this happen.

These tenders could further antagonize players and agents in the ongoing labor dispute. Teams are trying to restrict the ability of some of their key players to sign with another club even if their contracts are up. The big question, of course, is whether these tags are binding once there is a new collective bargaining agreement. The current CBA expires at the end of the day March 3 and talks are ongoing between the owners and players' union regarding a new deal. When told that teams will be using restricted free-agent tenders, one agent said: \"The boxing gloves are on.\" Once a player receives a restricted free-agent tender, he can wait to see if he receives better offers from other teams before agreeing to a contract with his current team. If another team offers more money, the current team has the right to match it or receive draft-pick compensation depending on the level of tender. For instance, the Panthers are expected to place restricted free-agent tenders on running back DeAngelo Williams and Charles Johnson, even if they don't know whether the tags will be binding. Under the soon-to-expire collective bargaining agreement, players with fewer than four seasons in the league were subject to restricted tenders, but last season -- which was an uncapped year after the owners opted out of the CBA -- players with fewer than six seasons in the league also were subject to receiving tenders, greatly restricting the movement of many. DeAngelo Williams has been in the league for five seasons and Charles Johnson for four. Several players balked at having their free-agent rights restricted last offseason. Logan Mankins of the Patriots and Vincent Jackson and Marcus McNeill of the Chargers even sat out some of the season in protest before reporting. Marcus McNeill eventually signed a long-term deal with Chargers. Logan Mankins and Vincent Jackson received franchise tags from their teams this offseason. If these tenders in 2011 are binding, it again will limit where each player can go and what he can earn next season.

Jones and his entourage were ejected from the club, and police say Jones briefly met with the accused shooter, Arvin Kenti Edwards, moments before Edwards opened fire with a handgun outside the club.

He's getting his wish: his name will be atop the Broncos depth chart at quarterback whenever players reconvene following the league's labor negotiations. New coach John Fox said Thursday that Kyle Orton is his starting quarterback, not the popular but unpolished Tim Tebow. That could change in camp, of course, but Tim Tebow has a long way to go to catch up to Kyle Orton, a sixth-year pro who is a better pocket passer if not as bruising a runner. John Fox's comments at the NFL scouting combine in Colts echoed remarks made by new football chief John Elway at the Super Bowl. \"I don't think we'll really figure it out until we start competing,\" John Fox said. \"It's a group of three that are very capable. Right now Kyle Orton is our starter. We have a young guy, high draft pick, in Tim Tebow who got his feet wet last year toward the end of the season. And then, shoot, Brady Quinn I'm looking forward to seeing.\" When that time will come, nobody knows. The league's contract with the union expires at the end of the day March 3, and players are expecting a protracted lockout by owners pushing for more games and a tighter grip on revenues. After signing his four-year extension this week, Broncos captain Champ Bailey said he didn't think there would even be a season in 2011. \"Not really. I've been pessimistic about this thing from Day One. Ever since our union leader came and talked to us last year during the season, it just kind of opened my eyes like there might not be football,\" Champ Bailey said. Elway told The Associated Press last month that if a work stoppage lasts through the summer, it would be hard to get Tim Tebow up to speed in John Fox's new system in such a short time. Kyle Orton started the first 13 games last season but gave way to Tim Tebow, the former Heisman Trophy winner and national college champion, for the final three games. Former Broncos coach Josh McDaniels traded three draft picks to select the passionate but unpolished Tim Tebow in the first round last year. By training camp, however, it was obvious that Tim Tebow was a project and Kyle Orton was the far better quarterback. Kyle Orton signed an $8 million extension for 2011 during training camp and then completed nearly 60 percent of his passes for 3,653 yards and 20 touchdowns with nine interceptions. Behind a line that included rookies J.D. Walton and Zane Beadles and a gimpy Ryan Clady, Kyle Orton was sacked 34 times, however, and eventually was sidelined by bruised ribs. He went 3-9 in his starts. Tim Tebow completed 41 of 82 passes for 654 yards with five TDs and three interceptions and ran 43 times for 227 yards and six touchdowns. He won one of the three games he started. Brady Quinn, whom Josh McDaniels acquired shortly before drafting Tim Tebow in a much-derided trade that sent running back Peyton Hillis to Browns, didn't take a single snap in Broncos last year. Although skeptics might think the Broncos are trying to increase Kyle Orton's value on the trade market, John Fox scoffed at the notion Kyle Orton was being shopped around. \"I think it would be pretty hard to be both\" Broncos's starter and also trade bait, John Fox said. \"As far as I'm concerned, he's under contract and he's our starting quarterback for the Broncos.\" John Fox also said he thought former first-round pick Robert Ayers will benefit from the Broncos' switch from a 3-4 defensive scheme to a 4-3, in which Elvis Dumervil will also move back to defensive end from outside linebacker. Robert Ayers has just 1\u00bd sacks in his two seasons in the NFL, and the team's evaluation of him will help them determine what to do with the number 2 overall pick in the draft in April, which they could use to select Clemson pass-rusher Da'Quan Bowers, who led the nation with 15\u00bd sacks last season. John Fox said that in his evaluation of Robert Ayers coming out of college, \"I saw him as a 4-3 defensive end.\" \"He has played primarily as a 3-4 outside linebacker. We have him penciled in as a defensive end. I think he was probably a little easier to evaluate coming out of college as an end because that's what he played at Titans,\" John Fox said. \"I have the utmost confidence that he will be a productive player for us this coming year.\" Fixing the deficient defense is Broncos's top priority. Josh McDaniels focused on offense in his two drafts in Broncos and the Broncos had dived to dead last in several defensive categories by the time he was fired in December amid the team's worst slide in four decades.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6154904", "Entities": ["Kyle Orton", "Broncos", "Tim Tebow", "John Fox", "Colts", "Brady Quinn", "Champ Bailey", "Josh McDaniels", "J.D.

I was thinking about snitches the other day because the U.S. District Court judge presiding over Barry Bonds' never-ending perjury case just allowed this fascinating secret recording of Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, to be admitted as evidence into Bonds' trial, which could start in early March. The recording, prosecutors say, features Anderson bragging in a low whisper to the husband of Bonds' former personal assistant about a specially created steroid that Bonds used. The money quote: \"You can take [it] the day of [the drug test], pee, and it comes up perfect.\" If the Mitchell report aspires to be baseball's official written version of the steroids era, the extended version of the Anderson recording could be the official soundtrack. Prosecutors think it's the smoking gun against Bonds that they haven't been able to get from Anderson directly because he has refused to testify against Bonds or anyone else for years. Anderson even went to prison for more than a year as a result -- and might yet again -- which has made him something of a hero to the anti-snitch crowd. But not me. I'd argue that there can be honor in being a rat, imperfect as some of them are. If Bonds really did use designer steroids, do you really want him being able to walk around preening about how he displaced Hank Aaron as the best home run hitter of all time? Since Mark McGwire's admission in the spring, can we now forget McGwire hugging Roger Maris' sons like some Judas the night he took their dad's record? Do you want Olympic sprinters to think they had to take steroids just to compete? (If not, thank Trevor Graham for sending a syringe with previously undetectable THG to anti-doping officials.) Do you want to shrug off the possibility that similarly undetectable drug use contributes to the fact that the life expectancy of ex-NFL players is only about 55? I don't have much use for the snitches behind \"gotcha\" stories like what Jerry Jones said about Bill Parcells late some night in a bar. But other snitches have given us vital information over the years about unsolved mysteries or even crimes that might have never been exposed. Snitches can perform a public service by illuminating whole new worlds or subcultures, stunning displays of deceit or buffoonery. It seems almost quaint now how surprised we were that Brett Favre and Tiger Woods, two aggressively self-promoted family guys, weren't the husbands we had thought. Cyclist Lance Armstrong might not be, either, if some talkative past teammates of his can be believed. Snitches can give us a clearer read on whom to lionize -- or not. Think of that mook, Tommy Gioiosa, who dropped the dime on Pete Rose for betting on baseball. Consider how Spygate altered perceptions of just how driven to win Patriots coach Bill Belichick really is. Kiddingly ask whether Sports Illustrated should've started drug-testing its swimsuit-issue models after Roger Clemens threw his wife, Debbie, under the bus and had her admit before Congress to taking HGH injections from trainer Brian McNamee for a bikini shoot she and the Rocket did for SI in 2003. (If not then, girls, when?) Titans coach Bruce Pearl used to get a lot of mileage out of people thinking he was among that brave but dwindling group, The Last Upstanding Men in College Basketball. Twenty years ago, when Pearl was a young Iowa assistant, he reported Illinois' possibly illegal recruitment of a player named Deon Thomas. The footnote was that for his show of principle, poor Pearl was blackballed within the game for years. It took Pearl 15 years to re-establish himself near the top of Division I but only six seasons after his big promotion to Titans to succumb to the temptations or survival pressure and push the rules himself. Pearl admitted he lied last year and actively tried to cover up excessive phone calls to recruits and use of unauthorized phones. The SEC suspended him, and the NCAA is considering how to punish him, too. I know a lot of people look at snitches and say they're as morally repugnant as the people they're accusing. And sometimes that's true. The more genteel term \"whistle-blower\" is usually reserved for someone who isn't involved in the activity he reports on, whereas someone like Canseco, who cashed in with tell-all books, is a rat. But at least he's a useful rat. Canseco helped crack open the halfhearted inquiries into baseball's sprawling steroid scandal. Still, the Canseco issue -- bad guy/good rat -- highlights how there are such things as Good Snitches, Bad Snitches and Accidental Snitches, too. The Clemens case alone could inspire a game called \"Rate the Snitch.\" Do you start at ground zero and nominate former Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski? He first told the feds about McNamee, which caused McNamee to get so scared about prison time that he sang about his former Yankees clients Clemens and Andy Pettitte, who never would have had to tell Congress all he knows about Clemens' HGH use, not just his own, if Clemens hadn't railed so indignantly to some pals in Congress about being named in the Mitchell report. Congress finally subpoenaed all three of them for a little talk -- under oath. Pettitte, who recently disputed rumors that he retired this offseason partly because he might have to testify at Clemens' trial during this season, is technically a snitch -- but he's a reluctant snitch perhaps on his way to an ulcer. The steroid scandals have been soul-deadening at times, not just a colorful insight into the secret lives of jocks or whether our government should be prosecuting some juiced-up sluggers and sprinters at all. But without baseball's forced introspection, there would have been no push for stricter drug testing across the major sports. It's a health issue, not just a sports issue or ethical issue. Sports shouldn't be allowed to coddle or encourage some gladiatorial class of drug users and frauds. So let's hear it for the snitches. It's somehow affirming to see that someone like Bonds or Clemens or even a church pastor like Cecil Cam Newton can't get away with everything just because he's more cynical or politically connected, richer or more egotistical than all of us dopes still trying to play by the rules. By now, maybe you even love a good snitch, too. Tell everyone you know.

It isn't just that it lacks a consensus number 1 pick in the Troy Aikman / Sam Bradford / John Elway / Peyton Manning mold. It also doesn't have a Donovan McNabb / Steve McNair / Philip Rivers / Matt Ryan type of midrange top-10-in-the-draft caliber of quarterback either. That type of perception may have some thinking that this will not be an impact draft year for quarterbacks, but the actuality of the situation could be the exact opposite. This year's talent crop does include four potential mid- to late-first-round selections in Blaine Gabbert, Jake Locker, Matt Ryan Mallett and Cam Newton. Those names may not have the star factor of a top-10 pick (Cam Newton's self-proclaimed \"icon\" comment notwithstanding), but history offers very clear evidence that quarterbacks selected later in the first round actually are -- in many ways -- just as successful as those top-10 choices. The evidence to back this up can be found in a study I did on quarterback selections from 1970-2006. The idea behind this time frame is to review selections made since the AFL and NFL merged their drafts and to limit it to quarterbacks who have had at least five seasons to prove their worth.

The former Notre Dame and Bears defensive back was interviewed by author Rob Trucks Nov. 27 for an oral history project about turning 50 in America. Excerpts were posted Wednesday on the website Deadspin. Duerson revealed that he was surprised to even be approaching 50. \"People would ask me about longevity and all that. I would tell them I was going to die at 42,\" Duerson said. \"And I don't know what that was about, but, as it turned out, you know, I did suffer the greatest death, from my vantage point, two days before I turned 43. \"That was the death of my mom, you know, my absolute best friend, my biggest fan. But Nov. 28th of'03, when I turned 43, I did realize I was likely going to make it to old age and so, from a mental perspective, I needed to get ready for things like a slowing gait and losing my step and failed health and all those types of things, whereas I'd always envisioned that I was going to go at the top of my game. \"I've always pictured my exit at like 75 or 80 miles an hour, and I just happen to, you know, fall asleep at the wheel or something [laughs]. \"When I turned 43, the first thing I thought was,'Well, I'm still here.' \" Duerson turned 50 a day after the interview. On Feb. 17, he shot himself in the chest and died in his Florida home. Duerson's family has agreed to donate his brain to Boston University's medical school, according to a report in The New York Times, for its study of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the degenerative disease that has been linked to depression, dementia and occasionally suicide in former athletes. He had filed bankruptcy in September 2010, but financial difficulties weren't the only thing haunting him. Duerson said his biggest regret was a domestic violence charge he faced in 2006. He subsequently was forced to resign as a trustee at Notre Dame. \"My wife and I had an argument in South Bend, and, you know, I lost control for three seconds,\" Duerson said in the November interview. \"That was a one-time event -- the most disappointing of my entire life, but one that will never ever be repeated.\" He and his wife, Alicia, later divorced. As for his playing days, Duerson said he was never comfortable with Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, even accusing the coach of using racist language against him. \"In the NFL, I was ostracized from Day 1 -- not by my teammates, but by my defensive coordinator,\" Duerson told Trucks. \"I was drafted by the Bears in 1983. My first day walking into Halas Hall, I met Buddy Ryan. He knew I'd gone to Notre Dame and asked me if I was one of those doctors or lawyers. I said,'Yes, sir.' He said,'Well, you won't be here too long because I don't like smart n------.' \"I worked for Buddy for three years, and there was not a day that he did not remind me that I was not his draft pick, that he did not want me there. It was not motivational at all. The guy simply hated my guts, without question.\" Ryan was reached by the Bears Sun-Times on Thursday and vehemently denied disparaging Duerson. \"That's bull,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"I can't believe he said that about me, because I was a great fan of his. He played great football. He was a great player. He started for us as a rookie. I don't know why he would say that. That sounds terrible.\" Duerson claimed that a few years ago, Ryan asked him for a hug when they ran into each other at a card show. Duerson said in the interview that he interpreted it as the former coach's attempt at apologizing. Duerson told Trucks that he used to consider himself a perfectionist, but an episode of Jay Leno's late-night show changed him. \"Jim Carrey was on, and Jay was talking to Jim about how awesome he was and about perfecting his roles and what have you, so he says,'You get into a part and you live the part and you are an absolute perfectionist.' And Jim Carrey says,'Perfection is God's business. I just try for excellence,'\" Duerson said in the interview. \"And I have to tell you, I dropped in front of the TV, man. I dropped to my knees in front of the TV and said,'Look, I'm sorry. Forgive me for my arrogance.' \"I know God is real.\" Hinting at the emotional issues that would ultimately be his undoing, Duerson said appearances can be deceiving. \"When people come up to me and they tell me,'Man, I wish I were you,' I tell them in the same breath that in order to be me, you have to accept my pain,\" he told Trucks.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6154991", "Entities": ["Bears"]}, {"title": "Talent abounds at among D-linemen", "author": "Kevin Weidl", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "The defensive line is shaping up to be the strongest unit in this year's class.

The team also reached a long-term deal with cornerback Stanford Routt and an agreement with defensive tackle John Henderson on a two-year, $8 million contract, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Raiders originally hoped to use a $3.5 million buyback option to keep Kamerion Wimbley under contract for next season for just over $4 million. But Kamerion Wimbley's agent, Joe Linta, said the NFL determined that deal violated rules prohibiting base salaries rising more than 30 percent in a year. That led to the Raiders decision to use the franchise tag, which is projected to be worth about $10 million. \"Kamerion is a great young talent and he and the Raiders are excited about him continuing his career as a member of the Silver and Black,\" coach Hue Jackson said. Kamerion Wimbley led Raiders with nine sacks last season after coming over from Browns in a trade for a third-round pick. Keeping him was a key priority this offseason for owner Al Davis. \"We look forward to working with Mr. Davis on a long-term deal,\" Linta said. The two sides can negotiate until the current collective bargaining agreement expires, which is currently scheduled for March 3. The non-exclusive tag means Kamerion Wimbley can negotiate with other teams. But any team signing him would have to give the Raiders two first-round draft picks as compensation. The Raiders' agreement with Stanford Routt is for 3-years and $31.5 million, with $20 million guaranteed, the source said. The Raiders would not confirm the deal but made clear their desire to retain Stanford Routt. \"Stanford Routt is in his prime,\" senior executive John Herrera said. \"He's a young, 27-year-old veteran, who already has six years of experience in the league. He's one of the fastest cornerbacks in the league and his best years are still ahead of him.\" After slipping behind Chris Johnson on Raiders's depth chart in recent years, Stanford Routt had his best season in 2010. According to STATS LLC, opponents completed just 39.4 percent of passes against Stanford Routt -- one of the best marks in the league despite being a frequent target as teams stayed away from Nnamdi Asomugha's side. He improved markedly from 2009, when he allowed opponents to complete 65.9 percent of their passes. While Nnamdi Asomugha was targeted on just 33 pass attempts this season, allowing 13 completions for 205 yards and no touchdowns, Stanford Routt was targeted 99 times. The completion percentage against him was the lowest in the league of any player targeted at least 60 times and was comparable to the numbers put up by the more heralded Nnamdi Asomugha (39.4 percent) and Darrelle Revis (33.9 percent). With Nnamdi Asomugha a free agent who might not return to Raiders after his $16.8 million option was voided, keeping Stanford Routt was a high priority. Henderson had 30 tackles in nine games last season for Raiders while being limited by a foot injury. The Raiders have now retained three key defensive starters, having signed defensive tackle Richard Seymour to a $30 million, two-year deal last week. Among the other key potential free agents for Raiders are tight end Zach Miller, running back Michael Bush, safety Michael Huff, and offensive lineman Robert Gallery.

On Friday, league officials are scheduled to unveil new guidelines by which all 32 teams use the same questions for players' baseline tests. The policy would also add a balance test to the list of other tests already being used. Previously, teams used a variety of questions on the baseline tests, which players must pass before returning to action, and the balance testing was not part of the evaluation process. \"A lot of people weren't doing the balance testing, which we think is useful, and the baseline information that people gather during the mini-camps, not everyone was doing as much as they could have been doing,\" Dr. Margot Putukian told The Associated Press. \"For instance, all the teams were asking questions, but they might not have been asking the same questions.\" Putukian, the director of athletic medicine at Princeton University and chairwoman of the league's subcommittee on return-to-play issues, said surveys conducted by the league showed not all 32 teams used the same procedures. In some cases, that may explain why players left games briefly last season, then returned, only to be pulled out later with concussions. It also can cause complications determining how many concussions a player has had when he moves from team to team. The standardized exam has three components: cognitive, with questions for the player; neurological, with the athletic trainer or doctor examining the player's eye movement and doing hands-on physical checks; and the balance test. Twenty-four symptoms will be listed, including confusion, headaches and trouble sleeping. The goal is to protect players from potentially debilitating head injuries and to provide NFL teams with more accurate information about the number of concussions players incur. It will also help the league gather more accurate data to study long-term effects of concussions. \"I think we're diagnosing them better and players are more willing to come forward,\" Putukian said. \"My job is to monitor and gather information and see what happens when someone has an initial injury, how long it takes them to come back, the types of concussions they have and to make sure that everyone is on the same page.\" While Putukian described the new policy as \"recommended\" rather than mandated, doctors who must deal with these types of injuries still call it progress. Dr. Henry Feuer, a neurosurgeon with Methodist Sports Medicine who works with the Colts, believes it will have a trickle-down effect for college and high school programs, which tend to have fewer doctors and trainers testing for concussions. \"Can we be perfect? No. But we want to get as close to perfect as we can,\" Feuer said. \"We're trying to set an example for every level of football. That is one of our goals.\" Player safety is also one of the hottest topics at this week's annual NFL scouting combine. On Thursday, everyone from team owners to draft prospects took questions about head injuries, and a group of NFL players also spent more than two hours discussing player safety in front of the competition committee. \"The main focus has been on player safety and how to cut down on contact to the head,\" Giants co-owner John Mara said. \"It's a challenge. [The players'] position is that it happens so fast, and our position is that you have to have a lower aiming point.\" Players understand the conundrum. Steelers backup quarterback Charlie Batch spent part of the meeting explaining the position of his defensive teammates, and Colts defensive captain Gary Brackett said some defenders expressed concerns of their offensive teammates. \"We're all teammates, in a sense,\" Gary Brackett said. \"I believe there is a happy medium, and there has to be some research done to find out where that area is so both sides can come to an agreement.\" Feuer believes the answer is simpler. \"I think because the equipment is so good, there's a lot of launching of bodies going on rather tackle football,\" Feuer said. \"Instead of trying to tackle, they fling their bodies at guys. That's not tackle football.\" Both doctors insisted players part of the responsibility lies with players, who they say must be honest about the symptoms they're having. Feuer said in recent years, he's seen more players come forward with concerns, something he hopes will continue. But the league isn't taking any chances. They want doctors to make the ultimate call -- and making them all off of the same card. \"The hardest thing about taking care of a concussion is its evaluation, its assessment because it's not like you have a bone sticking out of the skin or something,\" Putukian said. \"So it's not always easy to diagnose, and we just want everybody doing it the same way.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6156002", "Entities": ["Colts", "Giants", "Steelers", "Gary Brackett"]}, {"title": "Combine: Day 1 observations", "author": "John Clayton", "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Day 1 of the NFL scouting combine was split between two cities -- Colts and Redskins. While scouts and general managers started interviewing the first groups of players who arrived at the combine in Colts, commissioner Roger Goodell and NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith finished seven days of intense mediation. Though no deal came of those sessions, there was enough progress for both sides to meet again starting Tuesday in Redskins. Upon completion of the mediation sessions, Goodell and Smith flew to Colts to update everyone of what happened. So what did we learn on Day 1? 1. Lockout or negotiating overtime? Although it's hard to get a firm update about where labor talks stand, there is a growing chance the start of the 2011 league year might be delayed while talks continue next week. As everyone knows, the NFL can impose a lockout on March 3 if there is no deadline extension. With a mediation session scheduled Tuesday and owners meetings set for Wednesday and Thursday in Redskins, you get the idea Goodell will go to the owners Wednesday and Thursday with three options. Option 1 is for owners to consider extending the deadline into the middle of March or longer. Option 2 is for owners to make a substantial counteroffer. Option 3 is to have owners vote on a lockout. Stay tuned. 2. What about the coaches? Larry Kennan, executive director of the NFL Coaches Association, painted a bleak picture for NFL head coaches and assistants if the league locks out players. He estimates that 15 to 20 percent of the coaches may have reduced pay or could have their contracts terminated if a lockout goes at least 30 days. On the positive side, Kennan said 20 teams plan to operate as normal for the first month or two if there is a lockout, even though most NFL coaches have language in their contracts that could result in reduced salaries or possible terminations in event of a lockout. Kennan said Chargers, Cardinals, 49ers, Falcons, Saints, Bills, Jaguars, Patriots, Cowboys, Texans, Redskins and Buccaneers are the teams most likely to chop coaches' salaries by 20 to 25 percent in case of a lockout. Kennan added that the NFL Coaches Association is considering becoming a union after a dozen teams removed coaches from the pension plans and trimmed some benefits in the past couple of years. 3. Keeping an eye on Cam: The chances of Auburn QB Cam Newton going as high as number 3 in the draft seem to be real. The Bills are intrigued. General manager Buddy Nix, who has spent a career watching SEC football, mentioned the importance of not passing on potential franchise quarterbacks. It's a quarterback league, and at some point, teams that are down for talent need to draft a quarterback. Bills coach Chan Gailey said the team will consider all scenarios, but Cam Newton is one of them. \"I'm anxious to see what he's going to do this week,'' Chan Gailey said. \"He obviously had a great year.\" Chan Gailey prefers a mobile quarterback. Cam Newton fits that style. Panthers coach Ron Rivera said his team has targeted seven to 10 positions and quarterback is one of the positions. Still, the Panthers like Jimmy Clausen, so the odds of them taking Cam Newton with the first pick aren't very good. 4. Tim Tebow may be out-John Foxed: Although fans may be enamored with 2010 first-round pick Tim Tebow, Broncos coach John Fox isn't ready to jump aboard yet. John Fox said Kyle Orton is the team's starting quarterback, and he didn't sound like a coach ready to trade his starter. Asked specifically about an Kyle Orton trade, John Fox said, \"I think it's pretty hard to be both. But as far as I'm concerned, he's under contract and he's starting quarterback for the Broncos.\" Tim Tebow was Josh McDaniels' first-round choice, but Josh McDaniels lost his job during the 2010 season, in large part because of his roster decisions. John Elway, the Broncos' new vice president of football operations, is the only person in Broncos who has the clout to hush the fan support of Tim Tebow. If Elway would ever convey the impression to the fans that Tim Tebow is only a developmental quarterback at this point, fans would jump off the Tim Tebow bandwagon. 5. Nnamdi Asomugha's fate sealed? The Raiders will be having a slight changing of the guard on defense. Cornerback Stanford Routt agreed to a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the team. On the same day, the Raiders placed the franchise tag on linebacker Kamerion Wimbley. Those two moves could arguably cost them their best player on offense and their best on defense. With more than $71 million of contracts invested in Stanford Routt, Kamerion Wimbley and Richard Seymour, the Raiders may not be able to keep cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha. Unless they can get a quick contract with tight end Zach Miller, perhaps their most consistent offensive player, he could leave as well. The Raiders' list of free agents was so long, it was going to be hard to keep everyone.

(And remember, the league could be boarded up from a labor standpoint, but the draft will go on.) Even Cowboys, with Tony Romo, seems to at least have an eye toward the market, or at least the draft. With that in mind, here's the order I'd target the quarterbacks whose names are most often being thrown around in trade discussions right now. It's important to note that this list doesn't involve price, as each guy is coming from a different situation and their respective teams may be more or less flexible when it comes to dealing.

It will be another 4-6 weeks before Dez Bryant, who suffered his season-ending injury on Dec. 5 against the Colts, can start running fully.

He also had two punt returns for TDs. His speed and athletic ability have given the Cowboys hope he can get an increased role for 2011. New wide receivers coach Jimmy Robinson, who worked with Donald Driver and Greg Jennings in Packers this past season, will now get a chance to work with Dez Bryant. \"He's a very experienced football coach, and he's coached a lot of different kinds of guys,\" Jason Garrett said of Robinson. \"He's coached star players; he's coached role players.

Ahlerich, who served in the FBI for 25 years before being hired by the league, spearheaded all of the major security matters that consistently confronted the NFL, including the Patriots' infamous Spygate scandal in 2007 and Brett Favre's alleged dalliances with former Jets game hostess Jenn Sterger, which consumed his time during the second half of the 2010 season. Brett Favre ultimately was fined $50,000 by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for his lack of cooperation in the Sterger case. Ahlerich had targeted 2011 as a possible retirement year.

In the first real indication of what's been going on behind closed doors, the federal mediator overseeing talks said Thursday the two sides made \"some progress\" during more than 40 hours spread over seven consecutive days of face-to-face meetings, but \"very strong differences remain.\" The league and union will resume mediation Tuesday, less than 72 hours before the old collective bargaining agreement is set to expire. If there's no new deal in place by the end of next Thursday, the union thinks owners will move to lock out players, threatening the 2011 season. The NFL has said, however, that the deadline could be extended. The NFL also told its teams that they will not be allowed to speak with players and agents after March 3, and they will have to keep a log of who calls and why, league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter on Thursday. The league has emphasized that there cannot be any conversations with players and agents, and there also cannot be any contract negotiations. If there are, fines will be imposed. George Cohen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, released a statement shortly before noon Thursday, his first public comments since he began working with Commissioner Roger Goodell, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and their negotiating teams last week. \"At bottom, some progress was made,\" he said, \"but very strong differences remain on the all-important core issues that separate the parties.\" While Cohen did not name those issues, the biggest sticking point all along has been how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. Among the other significant topics in negotiations: a rookie wage scale; the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; and benefits for retired players. Smith and the rest of the union's negotiating team left the building at about 12:30 p.m., three hours after arriving. The NFL departed afterward. \"Just continue talking, man -- that's what we're doing,\" Colts center Jeff Saturday said as he got into a car. \"I think ownership -- everybody -- needs to know that we're all committed to it and committed to getting something done.\" Members of both groups now head to Colts for the NFL's annual scouting combine for draft prospects; the league briefed general managers, coaches and other team officials Thursday, and the union speaks to agents on Friday. Jaguars coach Jack Del Jack Del Rio says league officials spent 45 minutes updating team decision-makers about negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, what is expected over the next 10 days before the current CBA runs out and possible contingency plans. He did not elaborate. Now, everyone will wait to see what happens next week. In addition to the return to mediation in Redskins, team owners are scheduled to meet in nearby Chantilly, Va., Wednesday and Thursday. \"During the intervening weekend, the parties have been asked by us to assess their current positions,\" Cohen said. Jeff Saturday was one of four active players on the NFLPA's executive committee present Thursday, joined by Broncos safety Brian Dawkins, and Chiefs linebacker Mike Vrabel and guard Brian Waters. Nine of that committee's 11 members participated at some point during these seven days of talks; union president Kevin Mawae and Saints quarterback Drew Brees did not. No NFL team owners attended the talks in Redskins. Cohen asked both parties to keep quiet about the mediation, and union lawyer Richard Berthelsen said Thursday that gag order is still in effect. All Smith would say as he walked toward the union's headquarters was: \"We'll see you all next week.\" Seeking to keep a lid on what's happening in the talks, the NFL sent an e-mail on behalf of Goodell to team owners, presidents, general managers and PR employees Thursday, attaching a copy of Cohen's statement and saying: \"We will have no further comment beyond this release and no club or member of your organization should comment beyond this release.\" After months of infrequent and sometimes contentious talks, the NFL and union have been communicating regularly with Cohen present. The sides went more than two months without any formal bargaining until Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once the next week, then called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. During the mediation -- which was voluntary and intended to spur progress -- the sides have been talking both in full groups and in smaller subcommittee meetings. \"Our time together has been devoted to establishing an atmosphere conducive to meaningful negotiations and, of course, matters of process and substance,\" Cohen said in Thursday's statement. \"I can report that throughout this extensive period the parties engaged in highly focused, constructive dialogue concerning a host of issues covering both economics and player-related conditions.\" Also Thursday, there was a hearing before a U.S. District Court judge in Minneapolis to discuss the NFLPA's complaint that the league improperly negotiated TV deals. The union has accused the NFL of structuring contracts so owners would be guaranteed money from networks even if there were a lockout in 2011 -- while not getting the most revenue possible in other seasons, when income would need to be shared with players. It's not clear when there will be a decision in the case. Meanwhile, lawmakers from Indiana, home of next season's Super Bowl, on Thursday urged the two sides to avoid a work stoppage that would have a \"devastating impact\" on the state's economy. Indiana Republican Sens. Dan Coats and Richard Lugar, along with all nine House members from the state, made their plea in a letter to Goodell and Smith. The lawmakers said that their state, in particular, has a large stake in a deal being reached. \"As our state continues to recover from the recent economic crisis, it is critically important that the 2011 NFL season proceed unimpeded,\" the delegation wrote. \"...We urge you to work together to resolve these issues and prevent what would be a devastating impact on fans nationwide and particularly the Hoosier businesses and communities relying on the upcoming season.\" The NFL said in a statement that \"we are working very hard to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\" The players union declined to comment on the letter.

The union contends over $4 billion in TV, digital and wireless revenue was carved out by the owners as a financial cushion in case of a lockout, and they want that money escrowed so it can't be held as leverage against them in collective bargaining talks. The NFL argues it shrewdly maximized the revenue for all to share back in 2009 and 2010, and that lockout protection has been a normal part of broadcast contracts -- the league's economic engine -- for years. The two sides took their fight before a federal judge in Vikings on Thursday, a potentially critical issue just one week before their current labor pact expires. U.S. District Court judge David Doty in Minneapolis, who has had jurisdiction over NFL labor matters since a 1993 settlement he presided over that paved the way for the existing free agency system, unsealed some documents in the case with financial details redacted in many cases. Doty did not immediately rule, however, on the NFL Players Association appeal of a special master's decision earlier this month that lets the league keep the $4 billion or so in broadcast rights fees. (Networks would get a refund with interest if games are lost.) Doty said he didn't want to put his \"thumb on the scale of the collective bargaining\" process, as NFL attorney Gregg Levy contended union lawyers are asking. Levy said \"it would be repugnant to federal labor law\" for Doty to intervene in this issue. NFLPA attorney Jeffrey Kessler countered that it's the league's \"thumb on the scale\" in the labor talks, saying the billions in leverage was part of a long-devised lockout plan and that the NFL didn't act in good faith. \"We'd like the thumb removed,\" Kessler said. The collective bargaining agreement expires next Thursday. Lawyers for both sides, citing a gag order, declined to comment on the negotiations as well as how the case could affect the talks. The union contends the NFL failed to secure \"maximum\" revenue, as it is required to do, in both 2009 and 2010 when it re-negotiated broadcast contracts with Fox, NBC, ESPN, CBS and DirecTV that included revised \"work stoppage\" plans. The NFLPA said the work stoppage clauses in particular were struck to guarantee \"war chest\" income for the NFL, giving it an unfair advantage in the labor talks. \"Leverage, leverage, leverage. They said it to themselves over and over again. And why? To inflict economic harm on the players,\" said Tom Heiden, another attorney for the NFLPA. The league claims that seeking more revenue for existing 2009-10 deals would have been unsuccessful and angered the broadcast partners already dealing with a \"depressed advertising market.\" Levy said the league believes it followed sound business principles that brought in \"hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenues,\" citing specifically the creation of the new Red Zone channel that scratched an itch for fantasy football-hungry fans eager for updates on their players. Levy's argument was backed Feb. 1 by the special master, Stephen Burbank. In Burbank's decision, released for the first time Thursday, he said he couldn't believe the NFL had a duty to the union to \"throw budgets and business plans in the wastebasket\" even as he acknowledged the sharp disagreement between the two sides over how much the NFL can pursue its own business interests while following requirements of the labor pact. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell testified that the work stoppage fees \"could be used to meet\" NFL debt obligations and cover operating costs, the decision said. The decision also confirmed that Burbank had awarded the NFLPA $6.9 million to settle a dispute over revenue from an \"extra\" game granted by the NFL to NBC last season. The Oct. 31 game, between the Saints and Steelers, drew better ratings on a Sunday night than a competing World Series game between Texas and 49ers. Because the union asked for about $60 million in damages, Levy called the appeal bogus. \"The union took a big gamble. It didn't pursue damages in a coherent way,\" Levy said. \"It seeks a remedy intended to pressure the league in collective bargaining.\" The Star Tribune of Minneapolis and St. Paul Pioneer Press asked that all the evidence be made public, but Doty only agreed to a redacted release out of respect for commercial confidentiality of the TV contracts. Many figures and details are blacked out, though a few noteworthy nuggets emerged from the unsealing. The NFLPA's objection to Burbank's ruling includes testimony from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones that says the league needed to \"realistically assume\" a lockout to get a CBA it wants. It also includes chart-style NFL memos that acknowledge a \"strengthened position in labor negotiations\" as reasons for redoing the broadcast contracts. Lawyers on each side made impassioned arguments, but the tenor in the room during the nearly three-hour hearing was civil. Doty noted his long history with the league's labor issues and his familiarity with many of the attorneys in front of him. \"We all think of ourselves as old friends, at least I do,\" Doty said, later adding: \"I'm one of those odd judges who still likes lawyers.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6155512", "Entities": ["Vikings", "Saints", "Steelers", "49ers", "Cowboys"]}, {"title": "The NFL mediation outlook: a primer", "author": "Lester Munson", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "It's private. It's confidential. It's fast. It's highly fashionable. It's a hot topic in law schools and in seminars for lawyers and judges, who talk about it even more than they talk about money. When it works, it avoids endless and expensive litigation. And it frequently works. It's called mediation, and it's what has been happening for the last week in an attempt to reach a new labor agreement in the NFL. It's also perhaps the last hope of Mets owner Fred Wilpon, as he tries to settle an embarrassing and expensive dispute with the trustee who is sorting out the Bernie Madoff mess. As the costs of litigation skyrocketed out of control (the Wall Street Journal now lists lawyers who charge more than $1,000 per hour), the idea of mediation as an alternative began to develop in courthouses and in corporate board rooms in the early'90s. As it began to succeed, it became a regular part of the process in state and federal courts and in labor disputes. So what exactly is it? What's been going on behind those closed office doors at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in Redskins, where DeMaurice Smith and his NFLPA team have been meeting with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's staff of management negotiators almost every day since last Friday? And why aren't we hearing more about the content of those sessions? George Cohen, the FMCS director and the person currently trying to mediate the NFL labor dispute, not surprisingly isn't saying much about the process or the likelihood of a settlement. He has said \"some progress\" has been made. But he has also said that \"very strong differences remain.\" That's all we know. The two sides have another meeting scheduled next Tuesday, which is just two days before the current collective bargaining agreement expires. Can mediation solve the dispute at the 11th hour and save the 2012 NFL season? Here's the definitive, absolute, guaranteed-accurate answer: Maybe. Maybe not. Not good enough for you? Well, this might help. Here's a look at how mediation can work, based on interviews with a number of experienced and successful mediators. None of the mediators who described the process to ESPN.com are involved with the current NFL situation. First, as all mediators tell everyone in the first meeting, mediation is not arbitration. An arbitrator has the power to make a decision that ends a dispute and binds everyone to its terms. When an arbitrator looks at all the evidence and decides that, say, a shortstop's salary will be $8 million, that's it. It is the end of the discussion. Both sides are bound to accept the arbitrator's decision, whether they like it or not. If the NFL and the NFLPA were in arbitration, we'd be able to see a light at the end of this tunnel. But they aren't. The basic idea behind mediation is to put a trustworthy and independent person in the middle of the dispute to search for common ground that the two sides cannot see in the fog of acrimony that envelopes them. Unlike the arbitrator, the mediator cannot cram a decision down anyone's throat. Instead, the mediator simply listens to what everyone wants to say and then tries to find terms of settlement they may have overlooked. The process begins with the mediator gathering everyone into a conference room. \"We ask both sides to state their positions, and we ask them to try to do it in a warm and friendly tone,\" said Fred Lane, a nationally recognized mediator who teaches the process throughout the U.S. and the U.K. and wrote the definitive \"Media Practice Guide.\" \"There is no jury to try to impress. There is no judge who will be making a decision. We want to start a conversation on the issues.\" Establishing a mood of conciliation is critical, according to the mediators who spoke with ESPN.com. \"I have a few lines that can be funny that I try to use in the first meeting,\" said Faustin Pipal, a skilled mediator in Bears who began studying the process nearly 20 years ago. \"If there is no laughter, I know that it is going to be difficult.\" But whether the bits of humor succeed or fall flat, Pipal said he makes sure the people involved in the dispute are at least well-fed while they're in his meeting room. \"If they are passing the mustard to each other, it's a start,\" he observed. Lane, a skilled magician, has used sleight-of-hand tricks in his efforts to, as he said, \"de-demonize the situation and eliminate the hard feelings they brought into the room. It helps build a warmer and even friendly atmosphere.\" After the first meeting with everyone in the same room -- a week ago in the NFL case -- the mediator usually directs each side to a separate space and shuttles between them, exchanging information. This step in the process is known as a \"caucus\" and allows the mediator to search for settlement possibilities. \"We are not just messengers,\" Pipal said. \"We shape the message. It's an art. We present things to the two sides in ways that they may not have seen or may not have considered.\" In the exchange of information during the caucus process, the experts agree that it is critical that the parties to the dispute trust the mediator to keep everything under a cloak of confidentiality. \"They must be willing to confide in us and make us a member of their team,\" Pipal said. \"We call it the'Vegas Agreement' -- what is said in mediation, what is done in mediation, it stays in mediation.\" That explains the nature of the very few comments that have come from management and the union in the days since the NFL mediation began. To wit: From Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer for the NFLPA, after one of the early sessions: \"I have nothing to say, obviously. We're in a cone of silence.\" From Jeff Pash, the NFL's lead negotiator, after Day 6 of mediation: \"I just can't say anything. I'm afraid of Mr. Cohen.\" Generally, the first point of agreement in mediation is that anything that is said or offered during the sessions cannot be used later in litigation if the mediation fails. When it is working well, both sides view the mediator as part of their team, allowing the mediator to discern points of agreement that had not been visible when the two sides were arguing with each other. \"Putting the dispute under a public spotlight does not help,\" said Stephen Goldberg, a retired professor from the Northwestern University Law School who has taught mediation and served as a mediator in numerous disputes. \"It is critical for the parties to trust the mediator with their most sensitive and important information.\" As the mediator shuttles between the two sides, he or she tries to develop an idea of whether an agreement is possible. \"You try to clear away false barriers to a settlement,\" Goldberg said. \"You clear the emotion. You clear away misunderstandings of what one side really wants and of what may happen if there is no settlement.\" The NFL labor case and the Wilpon-Madoff battle involve complex issues in a large variety of areas. But sometimes, mediators agree, that sort of complexity is a help rather than a hindrance in the process toward an agreement. \"If you have a large number of moving parts, you can determine which are more important to one side and which are less important. If you know the relative importance, you can put together a package of compromises that may settle the dispute,\" Goldberg said. \"It can actually be easier than a dispute over a single issue.\" Obviously, it is important, the mediation experts agree, to keep the parties talking. \"If they are talking, you have a chance to settle,\" said Lane, who has participated, by his count, in more than 4,000 mediations. \"You never want them to terminate the mediation. If they claim to be at an impasse, you simply do not believe them, and you keep talking,\" Pipal agreed: \"If they claim to be at impasse, it may mean that they are simply trying to obtain one more concession from the other side. You keep talking.\" Lane described a tenure dispute at a Catholic university. \"There was dogma, there was doctrine, there was disagreement on religious issues,\" he recalled. At one point, the members of the university negotiating team concluded that they had reached an impasse and departed. When one of the lawyers realized he had forgotten a briefcase and returned to the mediation room, Lane asked him to sit down and talk. In a matter of minutes, \"We reached a settlement that solved the problem,\" he said. Experienced mediators agree that during the process they begin to see something that can lead to a settlement. And it can happen at any time. \"There can be a moment when you suddenly know that there will be an agreement. It's an electric moment,\" Goldberg said. \"Something comes along that you know will be the beginning of the end of the dispute.\" Has that happened in the NFL-NFLPA talks? It'd be nice to know. But, of course, there's that \"Vegas Agreement.\" \"You know we're not going to give you any information,\" Bob Batterman, one of the NFL's outside lawyers, told the media after one of the mid-week meetings. \"I can't say anything, other than the fact that we are meeting.\" The process can work, but it also can fail. During the NHL lockout of 2004-2005 that resulted in the cancelation of the entire hockey season, there were three attempts at mediation. All ended in failure. The final attempt came on Feb. 13, 2005, at the request of Scot Beckenbaugh, then the acting FMCS director. Although the hockey players union indicated for the first time its possible acceptance of a salary cap in Beckenbaugh's mediation session, the five-hour meeting produced no agreement. Three days later, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancelation of the season. It is perhaps worth a reminder that one of the NHL's management lawyers who led hockey's owners through that lockout seven years ago was Batterman, the same man now working with the NFL management negotiators. Although mediators carefully follow recognized procedures, unexpected things can happen -- things that would never be included in a seminar on mediation. Pipal, for example, was trying to settle a dispute over the dismissal of a church secretary. When the secretary sued the church and claimed gender discrimination, the pastor of the church made a bad situation worse by saying, \"I will never hire another woman.\" Facing an apparent deadlock, Pipal recalled that he asked to be allowed to converse privately only with the pastor and the former secretary. Alone in the room with two clearly hostile individuals as their lawyers waited outside in the corridor, Pipal said, \"I have no idea where the idea came from, but I asked them if we could pray.\" When both agreed, Pipal asked the pastor to lead them. The pastor's reluctant but increasingly eloquent prayer focused on forgiveness and reconciliation. In a matter of a few minutes, the mediation ended in tears, hugs and a settlement. That's the process of mediation: a lot of talking, some food, a bit of magic and maybe even some prayer. The NFL owners and players have certainly done a lot of talking. The same goes for both sides in the Wilpon-Madoff dispute. Maybe it's time for some food, some magic and some prayer. Who knows what could happen? Lester Munson, a Bears lawyer and journalist who reports on investigative and legal issues in the sports industry, is a senior writer for ESPN.com.

Jay Rockefeller wrote in a Redskins Post opinion column on Friday. \"What I'd like to see from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and the owners is a simple display of good faith: Show the union your books. Don't keep secrets. If there are financial pressures that keep you from agreeing to the revenue-sharing plan proposed by the players, let's see the proof.\" Rockefeller, D-W.Va., suggested that a neutral third party review the financial data, remove anything sensitive and prepare an assessment of the league's finances. The NFL declined to comment on Rockefeller's suggestion, citing a request by federal mediator George Cohen that the two sides not discuss negotiations while they're in mediation. Those negotiations are scheduled to resume next week. The league has previously said that the union, which has made similar demands, already has access to all relevant financial information. The biggest sticking point between the two sides is how to divide about $9 billion in annual revenues. The current collective bargaining agreement expires at 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday, and the union has said it expects a lockout to come as soon as the following day. The NFL hasn't argued that it's losing money, only that it needs to keep a bigger share to finance costs such as stadium construction. Rockefeller acknowledged that \"some owners make significant investments while managing a professional sports team and I don't want to play down their long-term expenses and obligations. But the players deserve a good-faith effort to demonstrate that these expenses are real and not just an excuse.\" He said that so far, he's kept a \"hands-off\" approach to the negotiations, aside from conversations on the status of the talks. But he also said that Congress, \"acting in the public interest, has to keep the NFL on track because of the great benefits given to the league by federal law and taxpayer funds and because of its impact on the nation's economy.\" One key benefit that the NFL enjoys -- along with other professional sports -- is an antitrust exemption for broadcasting contracts. That exemption, which allows the NFL to sign TV contracts on behalf of all teams, helped to transform the league into the economic powerhouse it is today. As to what the committee will do if the NFL doesn't provide the information, Rockefeller spokesman Vince Morris said that the senator is keeping all options open but is mainly focused on encouraging the two sides to sort this out themselves. Gary Roberts, dean of Indiana University Law School in Colts and an expert on sports, antitrust and labor law, said that whether an employer is required to open its books depends on what it argues during the collective bargaining process. \"If owners make representations that they're losing money or that they can't afford a certain term in the collective bargaining agreement, then they're obligated to prove their assertion,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6158810", "Entities": ["Redskins", "Colts"]}, {"title": "Bears raise ticket prices", "author": "Jon Greenberg", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "CHICAGO -- Even with labor trouble brewing and the date of a possible lockout a week away, the Bears announced they have raised ticket prices at every price point for the 2011 season.

The Bears made a surprising run to the NFC championship last season, losing to eventual Super Bowl champion Packers at Soldier Field. That game was one of the most widely coveted tickets in Bears sports history. The cheapest general ticket at Soldier Field, which has the NFL's smallest capacity at 61,500, will be $74, or $6 more than the past two seasons. General tickets range from $74 to $140.

Last year, according to the Fan Cost Index, the Bears had the fifth-most expensive average ticket at $93.55. They also had the third-most expensive \"premium'\" ticket (which includes club seats) at $372. The 2011 Fan Cost Index won't be released until September. If any games are canceled due to a lockout, refunds will be paid no later than 30 days after the final determination of a schedule is announced, according to the team's news release. This is the first time in three years that the Bears have raised ticket prices for all price points.

Johnson", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "\"They're trying to turn the NFL into patty-cake!\" I'm not sure who said that, although I'm sure someone did. Particularly during those tumultuous weeks in the middle of the 2010 NFL season when the league was handing out fines for \"dangerous and flagrant hits\" like Halloween candy. All told, players were fined about a half-million dollars after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made it his mission to protect defenseless players by cracking down on illegal hits. The enforcement party wasn't universally popular. Many players strongly voiced their displeasure. Steelers linebacker James Harrison -- who was fined enough ($125,000) to seed a small hedge fund -- contemplated retirement after being fined $75,000 in October for a hit on Browns wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi. James Harrison wondered if he could \"actually play by NFL rules and still be effective.\" The next month, his Steelers teammate Troy Polamalu, the Pro Bowl safety, called for players to be involved in the decisions on fines and suspensions, a request Goodell pretty much sacked. In between, players and fans wailed at the crackdown, bemoaning how it would transform the inherently violent game into two-hand touch. Then Dave Duerson put a gun to his chest. The former safety, four-time Pro Bowler, two-time Super Bowl winner (the 1985 Bears and 1990 Giants) and entrepreneur killed himself Thursday at his home in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla. His death alone was a tragedy, but we soon learned that it was so much more. Duerson had reportedly sent recent text messages to several relatives asking them to have his brain examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the disease often referred to as \"punch-drunk\" syndrome because it was originally more associated with boxers, whose profession was essentially a series of powerful blows -- many to the head. Now the NFL owns it. In CTE-affected brains, cells deteriorate and die over time, causing ailments including depression, dementia, violent or irrational behavior, memory loss and even death. It'll be months before we know whether Duerson, 50, indeed suffered from CTE. His brain is already at the Boston University Medical School's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, where, in partnership with the Sports Legacy Institute, brains of deceased players have been studied for years. Many have shown the kind of degeneration associated with the disease. Too many. That's why (and it's only one reason) the NFL's efforts to minimize -- not eliminate -- the potential damage to players should be lauded, not derided. Today, it's just a game. A tackle. A top-10 highlight. Tomorrow, it may be a life. Sadly, the initial word of Duerson's suicide was not wholly surprising. The list of NFLers who have taken their own lives for various reasons is not a short one. But add to them the former players suffering day-to-day ailments -- many in so much pain that they cannot lead normal, healthy lives -- and you have to wonder why the health and safety of players (current and former) isn't more than a seeming afterthought during the negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. Open the books. Close the books. Add an extra $1 billion exemption to the owners' pockets. Or subtract it altogether. Who cares how the millionaires and the billionaires split their $8.9 billion baby -- if the baby ultimately won't be able to walk? Or worse. The league has made it clear that it won't back off next season. \"We will take all the criticism and all the backlash against those that say we are acting too aggressively in this regard,\" said NFL VP of football operations Ray Anderson to a radio audience last fall. \"We are not going to be apologetic. We are not going to be defensive about it. We are going to protect our players.\" And that's to be applauded -- yet I also question the league's sincerity when it is seeking to add two games to the 16-game season. More games = more revenue. More games = more hits. More games = more Today it's just a game. Tomorrow it may be a life. Duerson was said to be suffering from headaches and loss of vision. Moreover, he was enduring financial strains. It was reported this week that he had filed for bankruptcy in September, citing $14.7 million in liabilities. He reported assets of $34.6 million, but that was mostly an uncollected judgment his food company won in 2004. We may never know what ultimately led Duerson to end his life. In time, we'll know whether he suffered from CTE, which certainly could have contributed to his death. We do know that he reached out to people he knew seeking answers. (And hopefully those relatives will allow the rest of us to know the findings of the Brain Institute once they receive them.) Yet in sending those texts to just a few close relatives, Duerson also reached many of us that he didn't know, and in so doing, perhaps he even quieted the debate over how hard is too hard in the NFL. At least until the next game. Or the next life. Roy S. Johnson is a veteran sports journalist and media consultant. His blog is Ballers, Gamers and Scoundrels.

Cam Newton led Auburn to the BCS championship in his one year as a starter, throwing for 2,854 yards and rushing for 1,473 and combining for 50 touchdowns. \"I think obviously that position of quarterback you're immediately going to start looking for leadership,\" Jones said. \"You're going to start looking for intangibles, and his physical abilities are pretty good. As far as in an interview, you're looking for a guy who is going to be the face of your organization that you feel like will be a leader for your team and is a winner.\" The Cowboys hold the ninth pick in the first round of April's draft and have not taken a quarterback in the first round since selecting Troy Aikman with the number 1 overall pick in 1989. Interviewing Cam Newton should be viewed as the Cowboys learning as much as they can about a player who burst onto the scene in one year, not a surefire sign they would draft him. The Cowboys have needs at safety, cornerback, offensive line and on the pass rush. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones has said he believes Tony Romo -- who missed the final 10 games last season because of a broken left collarbone -- is the type of quarterback who can lead his team to a Super Bowl, but he also wouldn't rule out Cam Newton. \"I wouldn't dismiss any player that's going to be in that draft and wouldn't express interest,\" Jerry Jones said Friday. \"So much happens with the circumstances that are there, not only on draft day but how we continue our process. But I do feel like we're in really top shape.... I'm going to really say outstanding shape at the position. Obviously, a quarterback to draft right now is a future consideration. For that reason, I wouldn't dismiss him or any position.\" Tony Romo is under contract through 2013. \"This is what we do every year,\" Stephen Jones said. \"You got to do all your work because you never know what's going to happen in a draft. It's part of doing your diligence as a personnel department. You can never assume anything and you can't leave any stone unturned. Give [director of college and pro scouting] Tom [Ciskowski] and our guys a lot of credit; they work hard at it and we get prepared.\" Because of the offense Cam Newton played in at Auburn and his limited -- albeit successful -- track record, there are questions he will need to answer in the next month or so. Cowboys backup Jon Kitna played well in Tony Romo's absence last season and is signed through 2011. Stephen McGee won his only start and showed potential in the final two games. He is signed through 2012. Todd Archer covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.

Only a few days after winning Super Bowl XLV at Cowboys Stadium as Packers's wide receivers coach, Robinson accepted the assistant head coach and wide receivers coach titles with the Cowboys. The Packers are viewed by some as a reincarnation of the 1990s Cowboys: a young team with a young star quarterback that will be a contender for years. Woicik spent 11 years as Patriots's strength and conditioning coach, equaling the number of Super Bowl rings he earned with the Cowboys of the 1990s with Bill Belichick as the head coach and Tom Brady as the supernatural quarterback. The Patriots finished 14-2 in 2010, holders of the best record in the AFC, and they have a plethora of early-round draft picks to supplement an already strong roster. Nothing in Packers or Patriots suggests any sort of impending downturn. So why would they leave for a franchise that has won one playoff game since 1996 and finished 6-10 in 2010? The answer is easy: Jason Garrett. So powerful is the potential, which was clear after taking over a 1-7 mess when owner and general manager Jerry Jones decided to fire Wade Phillips, that two of the most respected coaches in the NFL at their positions decided to place their bets with Jason Garrett. \"All coaches want to go where they can win,\" running game coordinator/offensive line coach Hudson Houck said. \"Winning is the most important thing, so believe me, OK, I want to be here with Jason. Everyone thinks he's going to be a winner. Everyone has such a great respect for him that they want to follow him. \"Somebody told me a long time ago that if you're an assistant coach you want to hook your wagon to a guy you think will be a winner.\" New defensive coordinator Rob Ryan and defensive line coach Brian Baker had only heard about Jason Garrett but quickly came away impressed with his organization and vision. Ryan needed a job after he was told he would not be back in Browns, but he had options. Baker was a month into his new job as the University of North Panthers's defensive line coach, but was swayed to return to the NFL. Robinson and Woicik, however, have histories with Jason Garrett when he was a backup quarterback with the Giants and Cowboys. Robinson remembers seeing Jason Garrett in the Giants quarterbacks' room studying game film two or three hours after his teammates called it a day. There talks were not so much coach-to-player, and it led to them discussing the possibility of working together one day. They both left the Giants after the 2003 season and reunited eight years later. \"I was just enormously impressed with his work ethic, his preparation and his demeanor, the way he carried himself,\" Robinson said. Woicik and Jason Garrett overlapped as coach and player from 1992-96, and Jason Garrett was always the last player to leave the facility. After each practice he would ice his arm for 30 minutes. When a player was brought in for a workout, Jason Garrett would be the quarterback throwing the passes. When Michael Irvin wanted to get in some extra work at Valley Ranch, Jason Garrett was there for him. Like other assistant coaches at the time, Woicik noticed. From the NFL scouting combine in Colts on Thursday, Jason Garrett spoke about his staff for the first time. \"One of the big things you have to do in order to be successful is pick good people,\" Jason Garrett said. \"That's the process we've been in for the last month in putting our staff together. Each of these guys I have some connection to in my past. Each of them I have tremendous faith and trust in as people and coaches. I think they've been at different times in their career at the top of their field. We feel that's the guy we're getting. I have a great comfort level with each of them and I'm excited to have them a part of our staff.\" And you can say Robinson and Woicik have that same faith and trust in Jason Garrett.

Just hours before the Packers took on the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, the NFL announced that 1,250 temporary seats were deemed unsafe and the league moved 850 people to new seats, but 400 fans were forced to watch the game from standing-room-only locations around the stadium. \"I do, along with the NFL, take responsibility for the seating issue and some of the things that we would like to improve on regarding the seating issues,\" Jones said during a 30-minute interview with Cowboys beat reporters Friday morning. \"The informing of the fans that were involved, the NFL and I take responsibility for. You always like to look at areas you can do better, get better. We certainly intend to and will get much better in terms of the seating and how that is handled.\" The Super Bowl ended a terrible week for the North Texas area. An ice storm and a blizzard in the same week left roads unsafe and forced the closing of schools and businesses. Jones, however, said there were many positive aspects surrounding the game and is confident North Texas will get the right to host another Super Bowl in the future. Yet Jones was mindful of the largest issue inside Cowboys Stadium. One company, Seating Solutions, failed to have the temporary seats in place before kickoff. Another company was asked to complete the job and also could not get the seats installed in time. Normally, the NFL takes complete control of stadium preparations prior to a Super Bowl, but that didn't happen right away in Cowboys. Jones wouldn't get into specifics of when the NFL took control of preparations, but league officials did say stadium officials still were involved in the construction of the temporary seating. The NFL announced that approximately 2,000 fans in the temporary sections will receive a choice of either a refund of the face value of their ticket or a free ticket to a future Super Bowl of their choice. Also, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said 400 fans who were denied a seat can choose one free ticket to next year's Super Bowl in Colts plus a cash payment of $2,400, or one free ticket to any Super Bowl plus round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations provided by the league. There were 13,000 temporary seats installed at Cowboys Stadium, and the Arlington fire marshal inspected and cleared 11,740 for use. \"One thing I would point out is that our stadium is certainly, the concept of the stadium, it was designed for the flexibility of temporary seating,\" Jones said. \"You can note those, but we have had several world-class events that were very much enhanced by the way our stadium is designed to increase our capacity by our temporary seating. So that is not at issue as much as it is evaluating what we did to create the criticism, to create the issue, and to do better in the future.\" The issue prompted at least two lawsuits, filed just days after the game. One suit, on behalf of people who watched the game on TV at Cowboys Stadium, alleges breach of contract, fraud and deceptive sales practices. The lawsuit is pending and the league has had no comment. Other than the seating and weather issues, Jones said he thought the North Texas area came off looking good and was proud of the North Texas Super Bowl committee's efforts. \"It met the task in my mind, the North Texas effort, both financially as well as effort-wise,\" Jones said. \"It was well-organized, and it was noted throughout the days and the weeks before the Super Bowl. It was really noted by the NFL and many of the people the NFL brings in, contractors and people like that, were really impressed with the structure of our North Texas Super Bowl committee and impressed with how it was executing in many of the things during the days before the Super Bowl when we were dealing with that inordinate weather. \"Many things went right and went to plan, to the extent that we, in any way we were compromised with the weather. I think that the fact that we hadn't had schools closed for four days ever, we hadn't had some of the weather issues we were dealing with, that will always be recognized as an exception for our area relative to future Super Bowls.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=6158100", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Packers", "Steelers", "Colts"]}, {"title": "Lovie Smith wants Olin Kreutz back", "author": null, "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Bears coach Lovie Smith invoked his inner marriage counselor in describing the team's desire to bring back veteran free-agent center Olin Kreutz. \"You married?\" Lovie Smith asked when questioned about the Bears' plans for Olin Kreutz. \"And your wife knows that she's wanted, right? Mine does. Olin knows that he's wanted.\" So by all indications, the Bears plan to make it a priority to bring back Olin Kreutz, who has started 134 consecutive games, for his 14th season, which should give the club at least some stability in what's sure to be yet another rebuilding effort along the offensive line. Near the end of last season, Olin Kreutz, 33, spoke often about a desire to remain with the team. Apparently Lovie Smith feels the same. Having already signed three contracts with the Bears, Olin Kreutz is likely to garner a one- or two-year deal with the club, and at this point it doesn't appear that compensation will become an issue. In the past, Olin Kreutz has turned down more lucrative contracts in free agency to remain with the Bears. \"Every day I've been here, Olin Kreutz has been here,\" Lovie Smith said. \"I believe in him. He's the anchor of our team -- not offense, defense, [or] special teams -- [but] our team leader. So he's very important to what we do.

It wants a deal. On Friday, union executive director DeMaurice Smith and four of the league's most prominent agents put on a unified front at the league's annual scouting combine. The hope is the union and the NFL can agree on a new collective bargaining agreement before the current one expires next week. If they can't, a lockout could begin next Friday. \"We want a deal and our hope is it will get done as quickly as possible,\" Smith said before entering the afternoon session of a daylong meeting with player agents. When asked to characterize the last seven days of negotiations with a federal mediator, Smith declined to answer. He said \"thanks\" and briskly walked away. In a text to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter, one of the agents in the room, who wished to remain anonymous, wasn't optimistic about the progress of the labor talks. \"Not close on one single issue,\" said the text, transmitted during the morning session. \"This WILL go into september.\" The union and owners have abided by mediator George Cohen's request to keep quiet about negotiations, even as the league and union have spent the past two days going over contingency plans and possible lockout rules. The union took the unusual step of putting Tom Condon, Ben Dogra, Drew Rosenhaus and Joel Segal side-by-side in a show of support for the players. The agents represent some of the league's biggest names, including brothers Peyton and Eli Manning, Michael Vick, Drew Brees and Terrell Owens. \"The agents are unified. We are 100 percent behind Dee Smith and my clients are 100 percent behind Dee Smith,\" Rosenhaus said. \"He's doing everything he can to get a fair deal with the owners.\" It's been a strange week at the combine, one of the league's biggest and busiest offseason events. Three blocks away from the opening workouts at Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Colts and next year's Super Bowl, Smith was talking to agents about how to handle a lockout. On Thursday, the same day the Super Bowl host committee unveiled its logo, NFL officials were discussing contingency plans with coaches and general managers in a local hotel. Jaguars coach Jack Del Jack Del Rio called it an informational session. \"We know we're going to play football in 2011, so our preparation has not changed one bit,\" Texans coach Gary Kubiak said Friday. \"Like everyone else, if [a lockout] does take place, we'll adjust and be able to handle it.\" And then there are the NFL prospects showing off their talents for interested teams. During Smith's speech, some agents at the closed-door meeting began tweeting that a lockout would prevent draft prospects from speaking with team representatives during pre-draft workouts on their college campuses. NFLPA spokesman George Atallah and the four agents quickly quashed those reports. \"With draft-eligible players, we will continue on as we have in the past,\" Condon said. \"We anticipate they will work out here, they will do their pro days and they will have visits with those teams.\" The future pros, who aren't in the union yet, didn't know it was an issue. \"I haven't heard any of that,\" Nebraska receiver Niles Paul said. \"Honestly, as of right now, I'm not focused on that. I'm only doing what I can control. I'm confident they'll get a deal done, but I'm here for the combine and trying to put myself in the best position to be drafted.\" Players and teams will have to deal with plenty of other obstacles, though. Without a CBA, the agents said, free agency would be delayed and the players selected in April's draft would not be able to sign contracts. Teams, they believe, also would not be permitted to cut players or sign undrafted free agents immediately after the draft. \"I'm optimistic,\" Rosenhaus said. \"Things have never been better in the league, and I think this deal has been extremely fair and that they [the owners] could hurt the game dramatically by locking the players out.\" The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. Owners want a greater percentage of the roughly $9 billion in annual revenue that is shared with the players. Among the other significant topics in negotiations: a rookie wage scale; the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; and benefits for retired players. The threat of a lockout has sped up the pace of negotiations. After months of infrequent and sometimes contentious talks, the sides went more than two months without any formal bargaining until Feb. 5, the day before the Super Bowl. The sides met again once the next week, then called off a second meeting that had been scheduled for the following day. But over the previous seven days, the two sides spent more than 40 hours in front of Cohen. Those talks ended Thursday and are scheduled to resume Tuesday. \"The players want football to continue, the fans have made it abundantly clear they want to see football and the businesses want football to continue, too,\" Smith said.

As usual, the coach was elusive in divulging medical information pertaining to Jay Cutler, who suffered an MCL sprain in the Bears' season-ending loss to the Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Asked whether Jay Cutler was healthy, Smith said, \"Sure, I assume he is.\" Asked whether team doctors have taken a look recently at Jay Cutler's knee, Smith said: \"I'm not going to go into any of that. Jay is doing fine like the rest of our team.\" Widely criticized by analysts and several of his NFL peers for leaving the NFC title game because of the injury, Jay Cutler became the topic of discussion in the media room at Lucas Oil Stadium. Smith said it was \"a shame\" Jay Cutler absorbed so much criticism. \"You know, just to kind of hit [on] Jay one more time: No, there's no question about Jay's toughness or anything like that,\" Smith said. \"For guys to even challenge that or question that don't know what they're talking about, don't know him. He's as tough as any quarterback in the league, and [I've] really kind of said enough about him.\" Jay Cutler's absence from the public eye in recent weeks and Smith's refusal to divulge information would indicate somewhat of a disconnect between the quarterback and the team. But clearly, that's not the case, Smith explained, when he was answering a question totally unrelated to Jay Cutler. Other than a few snippets of video footage online, Jay Cutler has stayed out of sight. But that's not uncommon for players at this time of the year. \"I haven't spent a lot of time with our players,\" Smith said. \"I encourage them to all go off and do their thing, get away from football for a while.\" Michael C.

Three NFL players -- Panthers center Ryan Kalil, Jets linebacker David Harris and Steelers linebacker LaMarr Woodley -- have signed their franchise tenders. Logan Mankins remains undecided. In one respect, Logan Mankins could guarantee himself a one-year salary of about $10 million by signing the tender, which is attractive given the NFL's labor uncertainty. But by signing the tender, Logan Mankins would forgo the possibility to fight the tag in the event of a lockout, which could get him what he desires: a shot at unrestricted free-agency and more long-term security. \"There are a lot of variables and a lot of issues out there,\" Bauer said from the NFL Combine, where he made headlines in Patriots Thursday by calling the Patriots' handling of Logan Mankins a \"travesty.\" \"At some point in time, maybe there aren't [franchise] tags anymore, in a new [collective bargaining agreement]. That's really a long stretch, but the union is saying there are no tags, but the NFL is still using them. So maybe there becomes a fight over this.\" Bauer, who had talks with the Patriots earlier this year, wants more time to analyze what is best for Logan Mankins, a seven-year veteran. \"We're looking at our options and considering everything right now,\" he said. \"You never know, because so many things are up in the air right now with the lockout and everything else. It comes down to the uncertainty of the cap and whether there is a new CBA.\" Asked if he felt his remarks Thursday could make it harder to reach an extension with the Patriots, Bauer didn't think they would. \"We go our path. They'll go their path,\" he said. At this time, those paths aren't leading to the same place. \"You would hope we could come together, but it doesn't seem that way,\" he said. \"We haven't been able to agree in our last talks, so they naturally exercised their right to the franchise tag, which they said they would never do, because they said a guard was never worth it.\" When asked for their reaction to the latest comments from Bauer, the Patriots elected not to comment. Speaking at the Super Bowl earlier this month, Patriots owner Robert Kraft said his hope was that the team and Logan Mankins come to terms on a long-term deal to keep him in Patriots, a stance he reiterated after the team placed the franchise tag on him a short time later. Bauer didn't rule out the possibility of an extension, even if he disagrees with the Patriots' approach. \"I've always had great respect for [Robert] Kraft and Bill Belichick, but it's a situation where this is one of the better players who has gone through there and it's tough the way it's been handled,\" he said. \"I understand their points.

Rex Ryan guaranteed -- again -- that the Jets will win it all. \"I believe this is the year we're going to win,\" Rex Ryan said during his news conference at the scouting combine. \"I guarantee we'll win [the Super Bowl] this year. I'm trying to will a championship.\" After two straight AFC Championship Game losses, Rex Ryan is positive that his Jets will finally get over the hump this season. However, Rex Ryan did admit that the Jets aren't yet the best team in their own division. When asked if the Jets have finally passed the Patriots after beating them twice this past season, including in the playoffs, Rex Ryan said, \"No.\" \"They were the AFC [East] division champions the last two years so I would say without question we are behind them still,\" Rex Ryan said. There's no doubt the Jets have a good thing going, but before they can win a Super Bowl, Rex Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum have the tough task of trying to keep a successful roster together with several players with expiring contracts. Linebacker David Harris signed his franchise tender on Wednesday but wide receivers Santonio Holmes, Braylon Edwards and Brad Smith, along with cornerback Antonio Cromartie, are among several key Jets who will be looking for new deals. \"We want all our players back,\" Rex Ryan said. \"We know that is not realistic but we know we have an outstanding football team. But I can tell you one thing, we are not making any excuses.\" And that goes for Rex Ryan's championship boasts as well. Until proven wrong, Rex Ryan will keep saying that the Jets will be Super Bowl champions. \"I don't care what people think,\" Rex Ryan said. \"I care what our organization believes and what our fans believe. It might not appear that we have gotten better [after two straight AFC Championship losses], but I thought we got a lot better last year. If we can improve a little bit more, then why not us? \"I'm always going to say the same thing. I believe we can be champs. Why wouldn't I believe it?

Asked point-blank whether the Bears could again land arguably the most significant signing of the free-period in 2011 -- similar to the way they did last year with Julius Peppers -- Angelo leaned forward in his leather chair at a hotel suite near Lucas Oil Stadium and pondered the question. \"Can we get the big fish?\" Angelo asked. \"I don't know. I haven't seen the bait yet, and until I know how much bait we can put on the hook, I don't know that we can get the big fish. That's gonna be determined once we have a clear understanding of where the [salary] cap is [once there's a new collective bargaining agreement].\" In Colts for the NFL combine, Angelo said the team has pondered all the scenarios regarding a potential new salary cap, including the remote possibility of a reduced cap. The Bears have approximately $105 million committed to players on the roster for 2011, and they are one of 20 teams around the league with more than $100 million devoted to players for the 2011 season. While the cap for 2011 remains an unknown without a new CBA, in 2007 the cap of $109 million increased to $116 million in 2008, and $128 million in 2009, which was the last capped season. The Bears allocated a reported $131.9 million in the uncapped 2010 season. But Angelo doesn't anticipate any scenario involving the potential cap hindering the team's ability to be a major player in free agency. \"We will be able to do things in free agency regardless of what the scenario of the cap is,\" Angelo said. Angelo also said he won't be given the team's budget for free agency from ownership until a new CBA and salary cap is in place. Angelo pointed out \"there is going to be a bevy of players out there in free agency\" this offseason, and he has shown a penchant recently for making splashy moves to improve the team. The Bears signed Julius Peppers to the most lucrative deal on the free-agent market last year with a contract that could be worth up to $91.5 million, and traded away picks the year before to acquire quarterback Jay Cutler. \"I think it's a difficult thing [to pull off those types of moves two years in a row],\" Angelo said. \"You don't want to come out every year having to spend big chunks of money on one player. That's not the goal. That's not something we set out to do each and every year.\" But it's not out of the question again in 2011, it appears. But Angelo also cautioned against employing a philosophy hinging on the team thinking it's just one player away from winning a Super Bowl because \"that hit or miss rarely hits,\" he said. \"From my perspective, I would like the draft to come first because free agency, obviously, is more expensive to fill your needs and whatever else you want to do. In the ideal world I would like to fill our needs in the draft,\" Angelo said. \"What we can't get accomplished in the draft, then you [get in] free agency. \"We play by the rules and whatever the first pool of players is available to us -- and normally it has been free agency -- that's the pool that you aggressively go at to fill your needs. Hopefully, it will continue to be the same. Then we go into the draft and do the cleanup work, so to speak.\" Michael C.

I know there are Bears fans who loathe Lovie Smith with a hatred generally reserved for election season robo-calls, and there are some who stand up for him with an annoyingly contrarian bent. Some only \"likey\" the coach. The truth is Lovie Smith is a good NFL coach who fits the ethos of his organization and operates with the trust of his players. There was no reason not to give him this modest extension. Given the general outline of what a professional football coach should do -- be the public face of the team, delegate responsibility to assistants, inspire confidence in the players, organize the season and, most of all, win football games -- Lovie Smith did a fine job in 2011. Some of his calls were questionable (but find me a coach who is perfect) and at least one of the team's decisions was costly and outrageous ( Todd Collins over Caleb Hanie at number 2 quarterback), but that was offensive coordinator Mike Martz's call. Lovie Smith should have overruled it, but there's no guarantee it would have made a difference in the NFC championship game. The players backed Lovie Smith with their voices and their play, and the Bears surprised most of us with their NFC North title and unlikely run to the cusp of the Super Bowl. A Jay Cutler knee injury, a few bad defensive series, Collins and a generally uneven offensive performance kept the Bears from meeting Steelers in Jerry World. Lovie Smith was awarded a two-year contract extension Friday, shortly before the team announced it was raising ticket prices across the board. His contract now runs until 2013. He was in the final year of a four-year, $22 million deal. Sure, the dissenters have reason to question the timing of the deal, especially given the three-year drought that followed the last time Lovie Smith took the Bears to the playoffs, but this was a smart move. It was a no-brainer, as a former Bears coach was wont to say. Given the nature of his high-profile job, having \"lame duck\" status would have been an enormous distraction going into the presumptive 2011 season. Distractions, like penalties, are a coach's nightmare. Every week, players would be asked about winning for Lovie. Lovie would be asked about winning for himself, and on and on. By giving Lovie Smith an extra two years, it hardly amounts as a major risk. And just to digress, the next time you hear anyone empathize with the Bears about money might be the first. The cheapest ticket in 2011 will be $74, face value. As fans can attest, everything is expensive at a Bears game. Lovie Smith spoke to reporters at the draft combine in Colts following the release of his deal. He was Lovie-esque, if that's possible. \"Of course I feel great about the extension, like I have every day I've been on the job as the head coach of the Bears,\" Lovie Smith said at one point, according to ESPNBears's Jeff Dickerson. While fans may have grown disenchanted with Lovie Smith's demeanor at televised news conferences, Lovie Smith's equanimity is seen as a strength by his players. He doesn't throw temper tantrums but treats the Bears like professionals. And when he gets really heated, it resonates. It sounds simple, but it's amazing how many coaches don't have the self-confidence to act like a human being when they're in charge. Lovie Smith was so confident in this extension he had his son Matthew, a second-year law student, handle the negotiating, rather than previous agent Frank Bauer. After the Bears' Super Bowl appearance four years ago, Lovie Smith jettisoned defensive coordinator Ron Rivera to promote his guy Bob Babich. To a lot of Bear-watchers, that was the first sign of the fall. This offseason, the Bears moved to keep offensive line coach Mike Tice from bolting for a prospective job in Titans, and they return both coordinators, Martz and the extremely popular Rod Marinelli. While some decisions on veterans will be made soon -- defensive tackle Tommie Harris and center Olin Kreutz, for two -- the message is clear: Continuity is king. \"We have great players who come to work every day. We have an excellent coaching staff,\" Lovie Smith told reporters. \"I'm in position to be here and get that extension based on what the players and our staff have done.\" There are things I'd like to see change in 2011, most notably the postgame media ban on Martz. Because Martz is solely responsible for the offense, the team needs to allow him to speak to reporters after games, as it did with his predecessor Ron Turner. I understand the \"one team, one voice\" philosophy, but not letting Martz talk until the Wednesday following the game is silly and shows a lack of transparency. For that matter, it would be wise of Lovie Smith to encourage his quarterback to engage himself more with the media and, by proxy, the fanbase. Lovie Smith wisely protected what's left of Jay Cutler's reputation at the combine, but it's clear that Jay Cutler's persona will continue to be a lingering question. Is that important to him quarterbacking the Bears? Maybe not, but the questions about his image end up directed at the coaches and Jay Cutler's teammates, and believe me, they're all sick of talking about him. It's time for him to take control of his own public image, and I think Lovie Smith could help. Jay Cutler's performance needs work too. He showed flashes in 2011, but still had his moments. And if Jay Cutler can't work with Martz in mini-camps and training camp, he won't get to make the necessary improvements for him to realize his vast potential. While Lovie's new deal does little to stoke the flames of a Bears fan's soul, it's just as tough to get excited about the 2011 season. Offseason events like the combine, the draft, minicamps, whatever, lack a familiar buzz, because of the dour outlook of the labor situation. Both sides have reportedly been meeting, but there is little optimism a lockout will be averted. The collective bargaining agreement expires on March 4, and after that, it's anybody's guess when a new deal is struck. The best part about Lovie Smith's new deal, for everyone's sake, is that it's done. One less thing to worry about.

Stanford Routt agreed to a three-year, $31.5 million deal to stay in Raiders and will be guaranteed $20 million over the first two years of the deal. \"It's a great feeling to go back to a place you're familiar with and not have to deal with the'unknowns' and'uncertainties,'\" Stanford Routt said in a statement released by his publicist Friday. \"But the work has just begun. We have a tough schedule this year. My parents always taught me'finish what you start.'\" The Raiders have been the most aggressive team so far this offseason, locking up key players before the current collective bargaining agreement expires March 3 and a possible lockout follows. Raiders has signed defensive tackle Richard Seymour to a $30 million, two-year contract, agreed to an $8 million, two-year deal with defensive tackle John Henderson, placed a franchise tag worth about $10.1 million to retain linebacker Kamerion Wimbley and also signed backup running back and key special teams player Rock Cartwright. The Raiders have handed out more than $80 million in deals, including the franchise tag number for Kamerion Wimbley, as owner Al Davis is trying to get as much work done before the possible shutdown. \"I'd like to see more teams follow the lead of the Raiders,\" agent Drew Rosenhaus said at the NFL combine in Colts. \"The Raiders have been aggressive in getting deals done.\" Stanford Routt was a second-round pick by the Raiders in 2005 and earned a starting role by his third season. He then slipped behind Chris Johnson on Raiders's depth chart and started just five games in 2008-09. He impressed his coaches with his offseason commitment last year and won back the starting job, producing his best year yet in six years as a pro. He intercepted two passes and had a career-high 13 passes defensed, but it was his success as a man-to-man, coverage cornerback that made him a high priority to bring back to Raiders. While only 13 players were targeted by opposing quarterbacks more than the 99 pass attempts he faced, according to STATS LLC, Stanford Routt allowed just 39.4 percent of those passes to be completed. That was a vast improvement from the 62.7 percent mark he posted in his first five seasons. Last year's performance was the lowest in the league of any player targeted at least 60 times and was comparable to the numbers put up by his more heralded teammate, Nnamdi Asomugha (39.4 percent), and Jets star Darrelle Revis (33.9 percent). Stanford Routt was burned for five touchdown catches and was called for five pass interference penalties -- ties for second-most in the NFL. With Nnamdi Asomugha likely to leave as a free agent, Stanford Routt will have more responsibility next season \"Stanford had a really good year last year and there is no question he can be a number one cornerback,\" coach Hue Jackson said. \"He proved that he can go out there on the corner and play week in and week out.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6159813", "Entities": ["Stanford Routt", "Raiders", "Richard Seymour", "Kamerion Wimbley", "Colts", "Chris Johnson", "Nnamdi Asomugha", "Jets", "Darrelle Revis", "Hue Jackson"]}, {"title": "Jerry Jones not ready to move on", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Sitting in his suite at a downtown hotel on Friday, Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones talked about how he can't move on from the 2010 season. Jones, the face of the franchise, said he was embarrassed about what happened last season. He had so many expectations. Jones dreamed of the Cowboys being the first NFL team to play in a Super Bowl at home. Instead, he fired head coach Wade Phillips midseason -- something he didn't believe in -- as the Cowboys finished 6-10. Jones gave Jason Garrett eight games to prove himself, and the interim coach went 5-3, with three wins coming on the road. It gave Jones hope, thanks to the Cowboys' current talent, that a rebuilding process is out of the question. He's ready to roll up his sleeves and try to move forward, but it's hard. \"I haven't. It's there. Again, it's very disappointing, and [I'm] embarrassed about it,\" said Jones, who's in Colts for the NFL scouting combine. \"I don't want any of our players and our staff to move on from it. It should be a real motivation for everyone involved in this organization. It's even more embarrassing when you're here and you're evaluating talent.\" The day before, a relaxed Jason Garrett stood inside Lucas Oil Stadium talking about how the Cowboys' offensive line didn't play up to standards and how the running game didn't do its job in the first half of the season. He seemed determined to fix the team's problems. Jason Garrett has assembled a nice coaching staff led by defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, who has promised that the defense will be better in 2011. Then there's wide receivers coach Jimmy Robinson, who is hands-on and demands perfection. Defensive line coach Brian Baker comes highly recommended. Jones said Jason Garrett isn't smug and has no reason to be despite the strong finish to the season. The only goal around Valley Ranch is to win Super Bowls. That hasn't happened in quite a while, and Jones continues to chase that dream. Along with the rest of the front office, he's put together one of his more talented clubs in years. Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware is considered one of the best at his position. Nose tackle Jay Ratliff plays bigger than his size on some Sundays. Jason Witten is one of the best tight ends in the game. The list goes on. Wide receivers Miles Austin and Dez Bryant. Former Pro Bowl corners Mike Jenkins and Terence Newman. Orlando Scandrick. Rising tackle Doug Free. And with the ninth pick of the draft, Jones can add to his talent base. \"We do this year-round, but certainly it's a focal point right now at the combine,\" Jones said. \"You get uniformly across the board an assessment where our talent is, and it's a good one.\" The fact that Jones said he's still embarrassed tells you how determined he is to fix this mess. He knows the offensive line needs younger talent, and Jones wouldn't discount drafting a quality pass-rusher to help out DeMarcus Ware and ease the burden of possibly losing three defensive ends who are free agents. Jones wants talent. He's got a talented quarterback in Tony Romo but wouldn't discount drafting another one, such as Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton of Auburn. And as he shares in the responsibility for what went wrong in Cowboys Stadium during Super Bowl XLV, he's also taking the lead to fixing things. \"The embarrassing feeling is dominant,\" Jones said. \"There is nothing as far as looking ahead regarding what we can do that overshadows the disappointment that we had last year.\" Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/columns/story?columnist=watkins_calvin&id=6158398", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Wade Phillips", "Jason Garrett", "Colts", "DeMarcus Ware", "Jay Ratliff", "Jason Witten", "Miles Austin", "Dez Bryant", "Mike Jenkins", "Terence Newman", "Orlando Scandrick", "Doug Free", "Tony Romo", "Cam Newton"]}, {"title": "Lovie Smith extended through 2013", "author": "Jeff Dickerson", "date": "Feb 25, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Bears rewarded coach Lovie Smith with a two-year contract extension Friday following an 11-5 regular-season record and a trip to the NFC Championship Game. Lovie Smith, who had one year left on an existing deal signed following the Bears' Super Bowl appearance in the 2006 season, is under contract through 2013. Financial terms were not disclosed. \"Of course I feel great about the extension, like I have every day I've been on the job as the head coach of the Bears,\" Lovie Smith said Friday from the NFL combine in Colts. \"Great organization. We have great players who come to work every day. We have an excellent coaching staff. I'm in position to be here and get that extension based on what the players and our staff have done.\" Entering the final year of a four-year, $22 million deal, Lovie Smith said he is satisfied with the length of the extension, which now coincides with the contract of general manager Jerry Angelo, who also is signed through 2013. \"I feel very comfortable having three years on my contract. It's plenty of time,\" Lovie Smith said. \"I feel comfortable having all of us being connected together as far as the length of our contract. Again, I'm excited. It's exactly what I wanted.\" Angelo said one of the positives of an extension for Lovie Smith is consistency in the organization. \"When we get into the free agent business, to have some stability with your staff, agents and players want to come into situations where there is going to be stability,\" Angelo said. \"That is part of it. Not all players are determined by money. There are going to be a lot of players, particularly this year -- because there is going to be a bevy of players out there in free agency -- that are going to want to have some stability. That sometimes can be the tiebreaker. There are a lot of things that are positive that come from [getting Lovie Smith signed to an extension], and I feel like we have a good plan in order because our new coaches now have a year under their belts.\" Angelo let it be known the organization wanted to extend Lovie Smith's deal the day after the Bears lost to the Packers 21-14 in the conference championship game. \"Jerry and I have worked together well,\" Lovie Smith said. \"We feel like we have a good combination going, and we look forward to taking this next step.\" Since coming to Bears in 2004, Lovie Smith has won three NFC North titles and posted three seasons with double-digit wins (2005, 2006, 2010). \"We are real happy that it all worked out,\" Angelo said. \"As we said at the end of the year, that was our goal and everybody can walk away satisfied. We are real happy that we were able to continue to continuity we have, not only with Lovie, but with our coaching staff.\" Lovie Smith has a regular-season coaching record of 63-49 and is 3-3 in the postseason. His 66 wins are third-most in franchise history, trailing only George Halas and Mike Ditka.

Drew Rosenhaus, Joel Segal, Tom Condon and Ben Dogra -- four of the most powerful agents in the business -- went before cameras and reporters and stated their full support for the union as it tries to strike a labor agreement with NFL owners. Some members of the media suggested it was almost like a \"We Are The World'' inspirational song. Rosenhaus praised the Raiders for investing big dollars in Richard Seymour, Kamerion Wimbley, John Henderson and Stanford Routt. He also praised and offered his full support to the current mediation. Condon talked a little about how many of the rest of the teams aren't doing much in re-signing their players. Unfortunately for all involved, no one had an idea of what will happen next week, when the collective bargaining agreement is set to expire. Here's what we learned at Friday's combine. 1. No comment: NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith had nothing to report to the media and the agents after seven days of federal mediation. \"I'm not going to talk at all about the mediation sessions,'' Smith said in a 90-second impromptu briefing. \"First, we want to get a deal done. Our hope is we can reach a resolution as quickly as possible. I work for 1,800 guys who want to play football.'' Smith spent the morning with agents but didn't offer them answers. Smith advised agents to be prepared for a lockout next week, but he still hopes something positive will be done -- whether it's a deal with the owners or a possible extension of talks until mid-March. No one believes any deal can be done before March 3. The hope is for commissioner Roger Goodell to convince owners to either make a counter offer or agree to an extention and keep talking. 2. Clearing up some misconceptions: Condon and Dogra cleared up some false stories of what draftable players will be doing for the next few months. For draftable players, it will be business as usual even if there is a lockout. Some rumors circulated Friday that teams wouldn't be able to work out or interview players between March 4 and the draft if there is a lockout. Not true, said Condon and Dogra. Potential draft choices will hold their school and individual workouts and teams will be allowed to attend. \"It's business as usual,'' Condon said. Part of the confusion was caused by the no-contact edicts between teams and players. Coaches can't contact players on their own team until there is a new labor agreement. For example, if a quarterback is getting a new coordinator, he isn't allowed to come into the office and study the playbook with his new play-caller. If there is a lockout, there are no player trades, no offseason programs, no minicamps, no organized team activities -- basically no football. 3. As the Redskins' world turns: Redskins coach Mike Shanahan said he met with Fletcher Smith, agent for Donovan McNabb, for an hour and a half to discuss a season in which the quarterback was benched and criticized by his head coach. Mike Shanahan projected a decision on Donovan McNabb might not happen until after the draft. Under terms of his new contract, Donovan McNabb can be kept in the dark about his future and stay with the Redskins until right before the start of the regular season. When asked if that meant Mike Shanahan had to find a veteran or drafted replacement before letting Donovan McNabb go, Mike Shanahan noted the uncertainties of what is going on with the league and emphasized it was his opinion that nothing would happen with Donovan McNabb before the draft. Mike Shanahan said running back Clinton Portis has the ability to test the market because of his high salary and age. That would indicate he has given Portis permission to shop himself in a trade, but trades can't happen until there is a new CBA. 4. Ready to run: After training for seven weeks with his sights set on locking up his rating as the number 1 running back in the draft, Mark Ingram of Alabama showed up at the combine at 5-foot-9 and 215 pounds. He said he wanted to lose a few pounds to help with his speed during workouts. He knew there were concerns about a knee injury, so he spent extra time training and bringing down his weight with the hopes of wowing teams with his running ability. \"I felt I would be more explosive at a lighter weight,'' Ingram said. Mikel Leshoure of Illinois is ready to challenge Ingram for the number 1 spot at running back. Mikel Leshoure isn't going to concede anything to Ingram and says he should be the number 1 back. He plans to prove it in a workout. Mikel Leshoure said his training has brought him from his 230-pound playing weight to 227 pounds, giving him better agility. He says he's running in 4.57 range for the 40-yard dash and he considers himself a complete back who can run, pass block, run over defenders and catch passes both short and deep. 5. Failure to communicate: Friday was quarterback day for media interviews at the combine, and two of the most sought-after interviews -- Cam Newton and Ryan Mallett -- were unavailable for comment. Most of the other quarterbacks talked. Some thought Blaine Gabbert of Missouri came across very polished and confident while others thought his answers might have been little rehearsed. He had perfect answers for just about every question asked. When asked about whether he should go as the first quarterback in the draft, he said, \"I'm going to outwork everybody. That's how I was raised.'' Andy Dalton of TCU and Jake Locker of Redskins said they were hoping teams would compare them to the Packers' Aaron Rodgers. When asked about Jake Locker and whether he looked like another Jay Cutler, Mike Shanahan said he compared him more to Jake Plummer.

I don't know that there won't be but I don't know if there will be.\" Afterward, when asked about a possible reunion, Tom Coughlin didn't want to say much else about his former wide receiver, who was suspended and reportedly often fined for breaking team rules while with the team. Plaxico Burress currently is serving a two-year prison sentence on weapons charges after shooting himself in the leg at a New York nightclub in November 2008. General manager Jerry Reese has said the team will investigate the idea of bringing Plaxico Burress back. The receiver is expected to be released from prison in June and several Giants have said they would welcome their former teammate back. \"A little bit,\" Tom Coughlin later said when asked if he has thought at all about the idea of Plaxico Burress returning. \"Not much. There may be some further discussion. There hasn't really been any lengthy discussions to this point.\" When asked if he is more open to the idea than he was a year ago, Tom Coughlin said he didn't want to comment any further. Tom Coughlin also did not want to elaborate on comments made about him in January by safeties Antrel Rolle and Kenny Phillips. Tom Coughlin did say he talked to both players. The two safeties appeared on a Dolphins radio show last month, where Antrel Rolle said Tom Coughlin could loosen up a bit, and Kenny Phillips said he still was trying to figure out who Tom Coughlin is outside of his coaching style. Tom Coughlin did joke that Antrel Rolle probably would not have liked the stricter Tom Coughlin from the years prior to the Giants' Super Bowl season in 2007. Tom Coughlin made a concerted effort to show a more human side that year, and the team flourished that season. \"He should have seen me a few years ago,\" Tom Coughlin cracked. \"That's my response.\" Tom Coughlin was in a good mood and gave updates on a few of his injured players. He said defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, who missed all but four games with a neck injury, is progressing well but has not cleared the final hurdle toward playing again. Tom Coughlin said Mathias Kiwanuka did avoid surgery, a positive sign. \"Seems to be doing pretty well,\" Tom Coughlin said of Mathias Kiwanuka, whose contract will expire. \"I don't think the final hurdle has been overcome but the arrow is in the right direction. It's been positive.\" He also said guard Rich Seubert is recovering well from surgery on a dislocated kneecap, ligament and tendon damage. Tom Coughlin said that center is a position that may need to be addressed in the draft because both Shaun O'Hara (foot) and Adam Koets (knee) are coming off surgeries. The Giants draft 19th overall and there should be plenty of offensive linemen -- mostly offensive tackles -- available. Tom Coughlin also does not anticipate his contract negotiations to become an issue. Team president John Mara said Thursday that he has had some casual conversations with Tom Coughlin's agent about a potential extension. Tom Coughlin is entering the final year of his deal and Mara said an extension likely will be completed sooner rather than later. \"It's been said that it'll get done, and it'll get done,\" Tom Coughlin said. \"For John to say that -- it'll get done.\" Ohm Youngmisuk covers the Giants for ESPNNewYork.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=6158935", "Entities": ["Giants", "Tom Coughlin", "Plaxico Burress", "Antrel Rolle", "Kenny Phillips", "Dolphins", "Mathias Kiwanuka", "Rich Seubert"]}, {"title": "Cowboys don't rule out Cam Newton", "author": "Calvin Watkins", "date": "Feb 26, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Cowboys officials spoke with Auburn quarterback Cam Newton on Friday night for 15 minutes at the national scouting combine. Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner, talked with other teams as well. With the ninth overall pick of the draft, the Cowboys might not select a quarterback with so many other needs, but team officials are doing their due diligence when it comes to Cam Newton and other players. Cowboys officials plan on attending Cam Newton's pro day on March 8, as well. \"As far as any team right now, I'm not going to get particular about which teams that I'm interested in,\" said Cam Newton, who confirmed the meeting with the Cowboys. \"Right now, I'm interested in every single team that's in the NFL that's willing to take me as a player.\" Starter Tony Romo is signed through the 2013 season and backup Jon Kitna, 38, is entering the final year of his contract. number 3 quarterback Stephen McGee has started only one regular-season game in the NFL and the team probably needs to see more of him before making a true assessment of where he is in his development. Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones said he's pleased with the quarterback position, calling it \"outstanding,\" but wouldn't rule out drafting Cam Newton if he fell to number 9. \"I wouldn't dismiss any player that's going to be in that draft and wouldn't express interest,\" Jones said Friday. \"So much happens with the circumstances that are there, not only on draft day but how we continue our process. But I do feel like we're in really top shape.... I'm going to really say outstanding shape at the position. Obviously, a quarterback to draft right now is a future consideration. For that reason, I wouldn't dismiss him or any position.\" Cam Newton is projected along with Missouri's Blaine Gabbert as the top quarterbacks in the draft. But it is Cam Newton, coming off a national championship season, and his potential that has several NFL teams interested. There are numerous questions concerning Cam Newton's off-field problems, something he wouldn't talk about Saturday in a nearly 14-minute news conference. Cam Newton started the news conference by reading a prepared statement to clarify his comments about calling himself an icon and entertainer. \"For me seeing how it did happen, I felt it was somewhat misunderstood and it was partly my mistake for not making myself clear,\" Cam Newton said. \"It was my fault.\" Cam Newton, who will work out Sunday, said he loves the competition of the combine and is telling teams football is his number 1 priority. \"This whole path to where I am right now has been something of a whirlwind to say the least,\" Cam Newton said. \"But at the same time, this is what I signed up for. I'm blessed and I can't even say that enough but just to know I'm talking to [reporters] that 365 days ago, I was attending class at Auburn. Even the Auburn fans didn't know what they were getting at this time last year.

Well, I found some. How dare I, for example, not rank Michael Vick as a top-five overall player for 2011? Don't I know he finished first in fantasy points among all quarterbacks in'10, and that despite playing only 12 games? My answer: Yes. Yes, I do know that. It would be quite simple to make 2011 rankings that look a lot like 2010. In fact, it would take about three minutes. OK, just copy last year's scoring leaders into a new spreadsheet. Sort by position. Remove Brett Favre. Et voila! We've got ranks for'11! But guess what? History tells us that's not a particularly accurate way to predict the future. Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, and all that. Indeed, the key to success in fantasy football is to figure out how the new season will differ from the previous one. And one way I think the 2011 season will differ is that I don't think Michael Vick will be as successful as he was during 2010. Let me tell you why. In fact, here are 10 flashpoint players from my first'11 mock -- guys about whom I received the most questions -- along with my current thinking about them. I'm not promising you that I'm universally correct, because some of these predictions are quite nervy. But at least you'll get a sense of why I think these might be some of fantasy football's most important players -- to own and to avoid -- this coming season. Michael Vick, QB, Eagles (Mock draft position: Round 3, Pick 4). When you look at Michael Vick's season statistics for'10, there's a lot to like. He notched career highs in completions, pass yards, touchdown passes, completion percentage and yards per attempt, to say nothing of his career-best nine rushing touchdowns. Indeed, following his record-setting Monday night outing against the Redskins on Nov. 15 (in which he accounted for six TDs), Michael Vick had 15 TDs (11 passing, four rushing) and zero turnovers of any kind. But after that, I'm sorry, the worm turned a bit. In the seven games that followed (including a home playoff loss), Michael Vick's numbers took a tumble. He threw for 11 scores but had seven interceptions. He rushed for another six scores but lost three fumbles. His pass yards per attempt dropped from 8.8 to 7.7. His rush yards per attempt dropped from 7.8 to 5.7. His rushing touchdowns still made him a fantasy star, though he didn't quite carry all his fantasy teams across the finish line: His poor Week 16 performance against the Vikings (which helped cost Philly the NFC's number 2 seed) produced a good-not-dominant 20 fantasy points, and of course he didn't play at all in Week 17 against the Cowboys. The fact of the matter is that late in the season, opposing defenses decided to throw caution to the wind and do everything they could to beat the hell out of Michael Vick. In losing his final two starts (versus the Vikings and Packers), Michael Vick took an ungodly number of shots on a seemingly limitless array of blitzes, and he struggled through rib and quad injuries. For the season, his rate of 9.1 sacks per 100 attempts was fourth-highest among quarterbacks with at least 250 pass attempts (only Jay Cutler, Jimmy Clausen and Jason Campbell were higher). And he turns 31 in June. I'm not saying Michael Vick is bad. When he's healthy, he'll be terrific. I just worry the lightning he captured in a bottle last season isn't repeatable. I saw too many shaky decisions in December and January, and too many times where he was blasted by men 100 pounds heavier than he is. Add that to the VBD notion that reaching for quarterbacks early doesn't usually pay off, and I say Michael Vick will almost certainly be overvalued in your draft this summer. And I say the risk of taking him in the first round won't be outweighed by the obvious rewards you'll get when (and if) he's healthy. Ray Rice, RB, Ravens (Round 1, Pick 6). I've received dozens of Facebook and Twitter posts to the effect that Ray Rice murdered an innocent fantasy team, and will never, ever again be drafted by the poor soul who took him in'10. And I guess I understand it. Ray Rice's fantasy owners took him number 3 or number 4 overall in most drafts last summer, and he finished just 10th in fantasy points among running backs. He went from 228 fantasy points in'09 to 200 in'10. Worse than that, Ray Rice committed the sin of starting the year egregiously slowly: He had 71 touches for just 304 total yards and zero touchdowns in the season's first four games, and going into Ravens's Week 8 bye he'd averaged only 10.3 fantasy points per game. Heck, take out a 27-point Week 5 effort against the Broncos, and he'd averaged only 7.5 fantasy points per game. Ray Rice was far stronger in the second half, but for many of his fantasy teams, it was too late. They were buried, in part because of his awful start. Still, from Week 9 forward, Ray Rice averaged 14.2 fantasy points per game. His average week consisted of 24 touches for 124 total yards. Hey, I'd be overselling to say Ray Rice was great last year. He wasn't. And what's more concerning is that whereas in'09 Willis McGahee vultured Ray Rice's value (with his unexpected 14 total touchdowns on just 629 total yards), in'10 nobody in the Ravens' backfield stole Ray Rice's value. He accumulated 71.4 percent of Ravens's running back fantasy points (compared with 57.3 percent in'09). And Joe Flacco had nearly an identical season in'10 as he did in'09. So what happened? Well, Ray Rice did battle a knee injury during that slumping first half, one that wasn't bad enough to force him out, but which he says affected his explosiveness. But the larger issue may have been the Ravens offensive line. Left tackle Jared Gaither missed the entire season, and ironically Michael Oher was miscast on the \"blind side.\" Worse, usual right guard Marshal Yanda is miscast at right tackle, and Oniel Cousins is miscast as a starter (when he starts), period. Beat reporters seem to doubt that Gaither will be back, so the answer to what ailed the Ravens up front may not yet be on the roster, and that's a bit scary. That said, there's a very strong chance Willis McGahee will finally be gone from the Ravens backfield, and Le'Ron McClain is a free agent whom the Ravens mostly view as a fullback anyway. I believe Ray Rice will have a larger chunk of the offense in'11 than ever before, and I trust that the Ravens are smart enough to get their O-line house in order. And while his'10 fantasy owners don't want to hear this, 200 fantasy points isn't a train wreck. Ray Rice finished the year third among all running backs in total yards. Yes, his touchdowns have disappointed in back-to-back years, but I think that changes in'11. I'm ready to go back to the well. Frank Gore, RB, 49ers (Round 1, Pick 10). Yes, I still view Frank Gore as a first-round pick in fantasy. The irony here is I was lower on Frank Gore than most of my ESPN cohorts last year, precisely because I viewed him as an injury risk. Whereas some of my brethren had Frank Gore rated third or fourth overall, I had him number 8 overall, sixth among running backs. When the argument was made that Frank Gore would be awesome because the 49ers drafted Mike Iupati and Anthony Davis in the first round last April, I scoffed. Rookie offensive linemen do not a fantasy stud make, and that opinion was borne out by Anthony Davis' borderline terrible play. Frank Gore was quite good before his fractured hip (125.3 yards from scrimmage per game in his first 10 contests), especially in the receiving game. But for the fifth time in six seasons, he failed to make it through a full season because of injury. Now I'm guessing by ranking Frank Gore 10th overall (and eighth among rushers), I'm probably higher on Frank Gore than many of my colleagues, and I've certainly rankled readers who are fed up with Frank Gore's injury history. It feels weird to do this, because I argued in the opposite direction this past summer, but when you take an actual look at Frank Gore's injuries, you'll see that this hip fracture was actually the most serious of his pro career, the one that caused him to miss the most games. True, he's played 16 games only once in his career, but until'10 he'd also missed a maximum of only two-plus games. In'09, he nearly missed three full games because of an ankle injury, but those were early-season contests, and he still wound up as fantasy's number 6 running back. The bottom line is that I think it's fair both to cap Frank Gore's upside (as I did in the summer of'10) because of his injury history and to keep him as a late-first-round pick despite that same history. He'll probably miss more time next season. I just don't think it'll be quite as calamitous an injury. The reason I'm still bullish on Frank Gore, then, is a balance between what I assume will be more minor injuries and his usage pattern, which is excellent. The 49ers don't have a viable platoon partner for him. Brian Westbrook won't be back. Anthony Dixon has potential and will probably be Frank Gore's handcuff, but 3.4 yards per carry in his rookie season doesn't convince me he's ready for prime time. New 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh has no intention of shying away from his best offensive player, and Frank Gore is the very definition of an every-down back, as his receiving totals perpetually illustrate. I still make him a late-first-rounder, just as I did last year. Michael Turner, RB, Falcons (Round 2, Pick 2). Michael Turner is my surprise candidate to see his'11 value tumble way out of the first round. I didn't expect this to be the case. When I did my first ranks for next season, I put the Burner well inside my top five overall, where he usually belongs. His overall numbers from'10 look wonderful: eighth in fantasy points among running backs (and just three points out of sixth), 1,371 rushing yards (third in the NFL), 12 rushing touchdowns (tied for fourth), and a serviceable 4.1 yards per carry. Then I went back and looked at the tape. Michael Turner continued to be a battering ram through December. The guy will never shy away from contact. Unfortunately, he broke fewer tackles, he ran away from fewer defenders, and he rarely got to the second level the way he'd consistently done earlier in the season. The tape doesn't lie: The Burner slowed down in a major way down the stretch. The numbers back this up: In his final six games including the playoffs, Michael Turner averaged 3.6 yards per carry and broke only two runs longer than 16 yards (and none longer than 27). He was stuffed several times from an opponent's 1, and was replaced occasionally by Jason Snelling in short-yardage situations. I don't recall reading anything regarding an injury, though it's certainly possible; still, the worry I have is that Michael Turner just turned 29 and has touched it 382 and 346 times in two of his past three seasons. You know whom that reminds me of a little bit? Larry Chris Andre Calvin Johnson. Before his first high-usage season, Michael Turner had 228 carries in four seasons (with the Chargers). Before his first high-usage season, Chris Andre Calvin Johnson had 140 carries in two seasons. If anything, that would seem to mean Michael Turner has less tread left on his tires than an equivalent-aged LJ. True, it was a foot injury that ended Chris Andre Calvin Johnson's season in'07, and \"conduct detrimental to the team\" that submarined him in'08, but anyone who remembers those years recalls that the guy had lost more than a step. That doesn't definitively mean Michael Turner's best days are behind him. But given the way his season ended, it gives me pause. This is also still a player who doesn't catch the ball or stay on the field on third downs. I'm surprised to admit: I consider Michael Turner someone to keep away from this summer. Jonathan Stewart, RB, Panthers (Round 2, Pick 3). The Daily Show was disastrous for nearly the first three months of the'10 season. He took a clear backseat in September to DeAngelo Williams, then just as D-Willy suffered a season-ending injury, Stewart himself missed most of three games with a severe concussion. To make matters worse, the immortal Mike Goodson thrived in Stewart's absence, exceeding 100 yards rushing in back-to-back games when neither Stewart nor DeAngelo Williams had done so the entire year to that point. Then, Stew Beef got serious. From Weeks 12 to 16, Stewart had 96 carries for 531 yards, a 5.5 per-carry average. And he looked great. There was no Jeff Otah at right tackle and Travelle Wharton suffered a season-ending turf toe injury at left guard, plus the Panthers passing game was just about the league's worst. But Stewart crushed opposing tacklers, looked elusive and powerful, and gave the Panthers every reason to believe he could handle the full-time gig if D-Willy leaves via free agency. Stewart injured a foot in Week 16 and struggled Week 17 versus the Falcons, but I'd seen enough. Given how badly Panthers needs help at a multitude of other positions (including quarterback) and given that it has a new coaching staff in place (helmed by Ron Rivera) that accordingly has a longer leash than the departed John Fox, I can't imagine the Panthers tying up huge dollars in DeAngelo Williams when they have Stewart and Goodson on the roster for short money. And if Stewart is back as the lead dog without DeAngelo Williams, his talent makes him a borderline number 1 fantasy rusher. Clearly, he's had injury problems dating back to college, so there's risk here. But I think I've baked that risk into my ranking of Stewart as fantasy's number 11 rusher. I think he'll border on 16 or 17 carries per contest for an offense that's just trying to hang around in games. Reggie Wayne, WR, Colts (Round 4, Pick 1). Others claimed Reggie Wayne was ready to fall off a cliff last season. I didn't see it. I ranked him a very safe third among wide receivers, behind only Andre Chris Andre Calvin Johnson and (gulp) Randy Moss, and that wound up being an acceptable call: Reggie Wayne finished ninth among fantasy wideouts, and only three of the players who finished ahead of him, Andre Chris Andre Calvin Johnson, Roddy White and Calvin Chris Andre Calvin Johnson, arguably deserved a higher pre-'10 rank than Reggie Wayne. But you'd have to be blind not to acknowledge that some of what Reggie Wayne's detractors worried about came true. The overall numbers were still there. He grabbed a career-high 111 passes, second-best in the NFL, for 1,355 yards, third-best in the league. Only his six touchdowns rankled fantasy owners; that number tied for his lowest output in the past five seasons. But the knee injury we heard much about toward the end of'09 seemed to prevent him from getting open as much down the field in'10. The numbers say Reggie Wayne actually made more big plays in 2010 than 2009, but his yards-after-catch average declined to 3.9, his lowest in four seasons. And that's to say nothing of the fact that his yards-per-reception average was only 12.2, the lowest mark of his 10-year career. As the season wound down, we saw Reggie Wayne basically disappear at the hands of Rashean Mathis (a guy he usually torches), an ankle-hobbled Nnamdi Asomugha, Alterraun Verner and Darrelle Revis. And strangely, in a year when Cowboys Clark and Austin Collie were unavailable much of the time, Reggie Wayne saw his targets inside an opponent's 10 go way down: He had a league-high 15 such looks in'09, but only seven in'10. I'm not saying he's bad. So far I've ranked him number 9 among wideouts. He'll still be a major weapon. But this is the year I'm on board with a slight decline. Steven Jackson, RB, Rams (Round 4, Pick 2). There's a temptation to boil down Steven Jackson's fantasy disappointments the past couple years to a lack of touchdowns. He's scored only 10 times the last two seasons combined, and that's rightly been blamed on how mostly horrendous the Rams offense has been. But for as staunch an S-Jax defender as I've been the past few seasons, I think there's a second reason you can consider him a relative disappointment, despite the fact that he's finished a respectable 10th and 13th in fantasy points among rushers, and that's receiving yards. Remember back in'06, when Steven Jackson was doing his best Marshall Faulk impersonation? He caught a whopping 90 passes for 806 yards, totals that tied him for seventh among all NFL players in receptions and 35th in receiving yards. But look at his pass-catching numbers since then: 2007: 38 catches for 271 yards 2008: 40 catches for 379 yards 2009: 51 catches for 322 yards 2010: 46 catches for 383 yards That's pretty good. But it's not transcendent, and it's not better than the receiving production of players like Frank Gore, Ray Rice, Maurice Jones-Drew, LeSean McCoy, Matt Forte and others. It's an advantage I think I've always perceived Steven Jackson has had. But in actuality, he's a good-not-great producer catching the football. I won't be surprised to see Steven Jackson's touchdown total rise from the six he accumulated this year, simply by dint of the Rams getting better and Sam Bradford's continued growth. But we have to weigh the superlatives and the demerits here, and I'm starting to worry the demerits are catching up. Steven Jackson toughed his way through the full 16-game schedule in'10, but it would be incorrect to say he was healthy. Against the Redskins in Week 3 he was wishboned and suffered a nasty groin injury which he played through, and later in the year he suffered a broken left ring finger which required surgery. He is one tough hombre, but he's taken an awful lot of hits the past five seasons. In fact, here's a list of the NFL's leaders in running back touches since 2006: I mean, doesn't that scream \"Uh-oh!\" to you? It speaks to Steven Jackson's toughness, for sure, but it also screams \"Uh-oh!\" Right now he's 17th on my running back list. It's gotten to the point where his risk of breaking down is just too high. It may not seem fair to penalize him for being so durable, while Frank Gore has 256 fewer touches precisely because he's broken down. But I guess that's what I'm doing. Jahvid Best, RB, Lions (Round 3, Pick 5). I was pretty high on Jahvid Best before his rookie year: I had him rated 22nd among running backs, a strong flex and eminently ownable in all leagues. For a few weeks, he made that rank look smart. He scored four touchdowns in two games, rattled off 232 total yards against the Eagles in Week 2, and was the talk of fantasy football. Unfortunately, he also suffered turf toe, a condition he'd battle the rest of'10. In fact, both of his big toes were injured the rest of the year, robbing Jahvid Best of his trademark quickness. He was completely unusable in fantasy leagues, and did nothing at all to make my relatively lofty opinion of him look smart. But I'm going back to the well. What I saw from Jahvid Best in the preseason and those first couple healthy games was the kind of elusiveness and acceleration that perhaps six or seven current NFL running backs have. Really, I don't think Chris Andre Calvin Johnson or Jamaal Charles has much, speed- and quickness-wise, over Jahvid Best. In fact, I think Jamaal Charles is a very good comparative. They're essentially the same size, they both rely on not taking many big hits, and can each hit home runs on almost any play. The best news of all for Jahvid Best appears to be that to this point, the Lions have no interest in making their backfield a platoon. Yes, Maurice Morris started during the'10 season's final six weeks or so, but that was because of Jahvid Best's health. Reports out of Motown indicate Morris and Kevin Smith will battle to be the backup. So a vote for Jahvid Best is, frankly, a vote for health. And I can see how lots of folks would say that's not a very smart vote, because Jahvid Best has been beset by injuries throughout his college and pro careers. In addition to his toe problems, he's had surgeries on his elbow, shoulder and hip, plus missed significant time with a concussion. I think many experts will make the argument that Jahvid Best's body isn't made to hold up to an NFL-style pounding, and really, I don't have a good rebuttal. He's been brittle. But you know what? I'm still taking the chance. I'm staking a bunch on Jahvid Best this year. I think he stays healthy. I think he becomes the next big-play artist to take the league by storm. And I think if I draft him in the third round to be my number 2 fantasy back, I'll wind up one happy camper. Peyton Hillis, RB, Browns (Round 4, Pick 4). You have to look awfully hard to find fault with Peyton Hillis in'10. I mean, he was undrafted in pretty much all fantasy leagues, an afterthought in the Brady Quinn deal and a fullback-sized backup behind draft darling Jerome Harrison. Thirteen touchdowns and 1,654 total yards later, Peyton Hillis finished the year as fantasy's number 4 running back, one notch ahead of Chris Andre Calvin Johnson. Precisely because he was such an unexpected source of week-to-week points, Peyton Hillis became beloved by his owners. He was probably the steal of the year. But he wore down. There's no question about it. The numbers back it up: Through 11 games, Peyton Hillis averaged 4.6 yards per carry and scored 13 TDs, and in the five games thereafter he averaged 3.8 YPC and didn't score once. This is a huge, physical player who in his first two years touched the ball 99 times combined, and in'10, he touched it 331 times. You can certainly blame the rib injury that bothered him at season's end, but really, he lost some life in those legs even before the Week 16 Ed Reed hit that hurt those ribs. It's just really, really difficult for such a contact-seeker to stay fresh all year. There's every reason to suspect that Peyton Hillis may be the lead dog in a platoon next season, especially since the Browns just happen to have a likely pairing candidate on their roster already. Montario Hardesty was a second-round pick last year, a 225-pound mauler who, when healthy, is probably more elusive than the 250-pound Peyton Hillis. Each man is a good fit for Browns's physical offensive line, and in a platoon each would keep the other fresh. Now, Hardesty missed all of'10 with a torn ACL and came out of the University of Titans with a history of knee problems (having had three knee surgeries before his NFL career began). It would be foolish for me to promise that Hardesty will definitely recover, though early reports out of Browns are that he looks good enough to participate in all OTAs (if there are OTAs). But it's not foolish to proclaim that other things being equal, if both men can stay healthy, the Browns would probably prefer to take at least 100 of those touches Peyton Hillis got last year, and give them to Hardesty. And that's a reason not to be lulled into considering Peyton Hillis a first- or even a second-round fantasy pick. Dwayne Bowe, WR, Chiefs (Round 4, Pick 6). Dwayne Bowe finally delivered on his freakish athletic ability last year with a 15-TD season that almost saw him claim the number 1 spot among fantasy wideouts. (Only Brandon Lloyd delivered a higher season fantasy point total.) He also delivered career highs in receiving yards and per-catch average, and overcame a devastating Week 5 drop in Colts to at least display surer hands than he'd done in his previous three NFL seasons. But Dwayne Bowe is only 10th on my wide receiver list for'11 right now. The reason? It's his quarterback. Matt Cassel was shockingly good through November last year, but fell apart thereafter: And when you take a look at Chiefs's'10 schedule, you begin to understand why. For three months, the Chiefs played an unbelievably generous and cushy skein of pass defenses which included an eight-game span (@HOU, JAC, BUF, @OAK, @DEN, ARI, @SEA, DEN) in which all but one defense was in the bottom eight in TD passes allowed. For me, this isn't a case of Matt Cassel getting tired or hurt (though he did miss Week 14 with appendicitis), but rather a case of better defenses beginning to catch up to him. Certainly, the fact that Dwayne Bowe became such a fantasy stud with very little opposite him at wide receiver and a rookie tight end hanging out over the middle indicates that he's got talent to burn. We already knew that. But we also saw what it looks like when Matt Cassel goes cold: From Week 13 forward, Dwayne Bowe had 14 catches in five games, and left his hopeful fantasy owners in the dust when it mattered most. I think based on ability and opportunity, he deserves to be a top-10 fantasy receiver. But my worry is that Matt Cassel will lack the consistency to put Dwayne Bowe any higher than that. I wouldn't spend more than a fourth-rounder on Dwayne Bowe right now, and that's probably not going to be enough to get him. Christopher Harris is a fantasy analyst for ESPN.com.

He opened by reading a statement concerning recent remarks about being an icon and an entertainer. \"The recent comments I made were during the announcement of my new endorsement partnership,'' Cam Newton said in his statement. \"I was making the point that I want to be the best possible ambassador for them just like I want to be the best possible ambassador for whatever team I am lucky enough to play for.'' Being 2-0 with the media is one thing; convincing teams that wonder about his character is another. Cam Newton acknowledged he was hit from numerous angles in interviews with teams. One caught him off guard with a question about not following through with the play call. His plan Sunday is to wow everyone with his throwing. Nevertheless, Saturday was a good step forward for Cam Newton. 2. Hammering the Mallett: There is no question that Ryan Mallett has great talent. He says he can throw a football 80 yards and has been throwing a football a long way since he was in fifth grade. He's the son of a coach and he knows football. That was apparent last season when he improved his completion accuracy by throwing more checkdowns and fewer long passes downfield. Mallett has that country sound to his voice and, for whatever reason, is having trouble selling the idea that he is a mature leader of men. Early in his college career, he wasn't mature and had off-field issues. He tried his best not to answer questions on drug tests and off-field issues, and that left reporters wondering. When interviewed one-on-one, he comes across a little like the Chargers' Philip Rivers, who is a model of maturity. Mallett has first-round ability, but questions about him remain and that could make him a steal in later rounds. 3. Athletic offensive linemen: There may not be a great offensive lineman in this draft, but credit them with being thin and in good shape. Center Ryan Bartholomew of Syracuse was the most impressive and helped himself the most. He ran in the 4.9s for the 40 and bench-pressed 34 times with 225-pound weights. Nate Solder of Colorado might have secured the number 1 tackle job with his Saturday workout. Nate Solder showed up weighing 317 pounds and was very impressive. He did a 9-foot, 2-inch broad jump. His 40 time was 4.99, and he was impressive in the short shuttle. He was helped by not having tackle Tyron Smith of USC work out. Many believe Tyron Smith could have the potential to be a better blocker than Nate Solder. Tyron Smith didn't work out because of a knee injury. The question for Nate Solder is whether he won enough points to move into the top 10 of the draft. 4. Tight race for tight ends: Notre Dame's Kyle Rudolph is considered the top tight end in the draft, but he didn't work out because of an injury. No problem. He's projected to go toward the bottom of the first round. Several other tight ends closed the gap Saturday. Luke Stocker of Titans didn't hurt himself with a 4.76 in the 40. The big winner was Virgil Green of Nevada. He ran a 4.54 and had 25 reps of 225-pound weights. Considered a third-round H-Back, Green might have moved himself into the second round. D.J. Williams of Arkansas maintained his second-round grade with a 4.63 40. Kyle Rudolph rested, but others started catching up. 5. And now for the bad news : Giants general manager Jerry Reese leveled a bombshell with thoughts that the herniated disc of defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka could affect his playing career. Reese said Mathias Kiwanuka has been getting good medical reports, but the defensive end is not quite out of the woods with his neck problems. Even though he's 27, Reese said, it's possible that Mathias Kiwanuka may never play again. Oh, and there was little labor news. By March 3, the NFLPA must decide whether or not to decertify if there is no labor extension. An owners committee involved in labor talks met in Colts on Saturday. The showdown between owners and the union is getting closer. Things are too far apart for a deal to be made by Thursday. Lockout? Decertify? Extend negotiations? A decision may have to be made by Wednesday or Thursday. The clock is ticking.

But the Giants general manager did sound like a man who is looking for a linebacker. Reese described the play of his linebackers as \"OK\" this past season. Linebacker Keith Bulluck's contract is up and the team needs more speed and athleticism at linebacker. As for Jonathan Goff, who finished his first season as the starter at middle linebacker, Reese said he would like to see improvement this season. \"Jon did OK,\" Reese said of Jonathan Goff, who finished with 80 combined tackles and one sack. \"I think he can play better. I think we can get better production from that position, but all things considered, a first-year starter, Jon did well.\" Reese also will be looking at offensive linemen in the draft. Giants coach Tom Coughlin said on Friday that center is an area of concern with Shaun O'Hara (foot), Rich Seubert (kneecap) and Adam Koets (ACL) all recovering from surgeries. When the Giants pick at number 19 in the first round, plenty of offensive linemen, mostly tackles, should be available, according to prognosticators. With so many injuries to his offensive line and age creeping up on the starters, Reese may look hard at taking an offensive lineman. With a potential lockout complicating what teams will be able to do in free agency, the Giants may have to cover themselves in this draft. \"Obviously, our top three guys coming off surgery, I understand they're on the mend and on the way back,\" Reese said of his three injured centers. \"A couple pretty catastrophic injuries at that position, so center, we're always looking to improve every position.\" The general manager said he wants to add speed and he has needs at linebacker, offensive line, cornerback, safety and tight end. The Giants also could add another running back with Ahmad Bradshaw's contract expiring. Ahmad Bradshaw has been told that he will be a priority as the team wants to bring him back, and it would be surprising if Ahmad Bradshaw doesn't return. But the team's starting running back did wonder if the Giants can afford to keep him and Brandon Jacobs. Jacobs is slated to earn $4.65 million in 2011 and $4.9 million in 2012. \"We'll see, time will tell,\" said Reese. \"We'll see after we have more information about everything, we will see how that plays out.\" When asked about defensive tackle Barry Cofield, whose contract is also up, Reese said the team is \"in a little bit of a holding pattern.\" Reese has said he likely will wait for a new collective bargaining agreement to be reached before dealing with free agents. Reese was asked about Plaxico Burress again, and he reiterated that he will investigate bringing Plaxico Burress back as he does with all free-agent situations. But Tom Coughlin said there hasn't been much discussion about the former Giants receiver, who is expected to be released from prison in June. He is serving a two-year sentence on weapons charges after shooting himself in the leg at a New York nightclub in November 2008. \"Right now that's really nothing to talk about,\" Reese said. \"His situation is what it is until that changes. If that changes, we'll investigate that.\" Ohm Youngmisuk covers the Giants for ESPNNewYork.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=6161378", "Entities": ["Giants", "Keith Bulluck", "Jonathan Goff", "Tom Coughlin", "Rich Seubert", "Ahmad Bradshaw", "Barry Cofield", "Plaxico Burress"]}, {"title": "Draft options for pass-rushers run deep", "author": "Mike Reiss", "date": "Feb 27, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Every NFL draft is defined by something. The 2007 draft was considered light on talent. In 2008, it was the year of the offensive tackle, with eight selected in the first round, including Jake Long going first overall. The 2009 and 2010 drafts were highlighted by the franchise quarterback, with Matthew Stafford and Sam Bradford the top picks. As for 2011, the defining characteristic of the draft is coming into sharper focus after three days of the NFL combine. While there is tremendous hype around Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, more than anything, this is the year of the pass-rusher. Seemingly every personnel man who visited the media center here at the combine touted the depth of the pass-rush class, especially for teams that run a 3-4 defense. Rams general manager Billy Devaney, for one, said that high-quality pass-rushers can be found into the second round. Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli, Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland and Steelers director of football operations Kevin Colbert echoed similar thoughts. Unless they're all wrong, this is perhaps the best news that fans of the Patriots could hope to hear, because those who watched the team in 2010 seem to have all come to the same conclusion: Opposing quarterbacks weren't harassed enough. More havoc is needed, especially when considering that defensive lineman Mike Wright -- who missed the final six regular-season games -- led the team with 5.5 sacks. The key now is finding the right prospect to bring the heat, and the NFL combine should help the team take steps toward making the choice. Could it be Purdue's Ryan Kerrigan? He is one of the most explosive rushers in the draft, totaling 25.5 sacks, 42.5 tackles for a loss and 12 forced fumbles over the past two seasons. For teams seeking a relentless, disruptive playmaker, the high-motor Ryan Kerrigan fits the bill. But one aspect to consider is that Ryan Kerrigan's production came while playing defensive end in a 4-3 scheme. He didn't drop into pass coverage; instead, his responsibility was almost always the same -- get upfield and harass the quarterback. \"Our motto at Purdue was it's not enough just to get the sack or get the tackle, but you wanted to force a fumble and get the ball back for your offense,\" Ryan Kerrigan said. The Patriots run a 3-4 defense, so drafting Ryan Kerrigan in the first round would mean they either project him to outside linebacker --which comes with more risk -- or are comfortable investing such a rich asset in a player who might be limited to playing in sub packages when the Patriots employ a four-man line. Considering the Patriots were in a sub package 57 percent of the time in 2010, and ranked last in the NFL on third down, maybe that's enough for them to consider that option. Essentially, it would come down to this: Would the Patriots be willing to use a high draft choice on a player who might be limited to doing one or two things -- starting with a ferocious pass rush -- at a very high level? History says no, as the Patriots generally look for four-down value in the first round. Because of this, they often take themselves out of the running for top 4-3 edge rushers. Maybe, with their bounty of other picks, it's time to alter that approach if a player like Ryan Kerrigan (6-foot-3, 267 pounds) could provide a Clay Matthews -type impact. If not Ryan Kerrigan, perhaps it's Missouri's Aldon Smith, another explosive edge rusher. At 6-4 and 264 pounds, Aldon Smith is one of the riskier picks in the draft, as he enters after his redshirt sophomore year and missed three games with a leg injury in 2010. But there is no denying his explosiveness; he totaled 17 sacks and 29 tackles for a loss over the past two seasons. Like Ryan Kerrigan, Aldon Smith's role was most often to play forward, attacking the quarterback. He seldom dropped into coverage, so projecting him to outside linebacker in the Patriots' scheme makes him a riskier pick. \"I've done a lot of work with it since I got out of college,\" Aldon Smith said of dropping into pass coverage. \"The more I do it, the more comfortable I get.\" At the least, Aldon Smith could harass the quarterback in sub packages, but then again comes the question: Is that enough to warrant a first-round pick for the Patriots? In a draft stocked with pass-rushers, it is a compelling question to ponder. Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPN Boston.

It wasn't necessarily that they were spraying shots all over the place. It was that his old teammate always had something on his mind, particularly his children. \"Dave was just so proud of you guys,\" Wilson said during his eulogy Saturday, looking right at Duerson's three sons and daughter. That's how Wilson chose to remember Duerson on Saturday -- not as the hard-hitting safety who terrorized receivers, not as the guy who helped that legendary 1985 Bears shuffle to the championship, and certainly not as the man who took his own life last week. To the friends and family who jammed a Southside Bears church for his memorial, he was simply a kind and generous man whose caring nature belied his reputation as a ferocious hitter. A four-time Pro Bowl pick who played on Super Bowl winners with the Bears and Giants, Duerson committed suicide at his home in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla. He was 50. Duerson's death rocked former teammates and coaches, who recently said he had seemed to be in good spirits after going through financial problems and a divorce the past few years. At a reunion of the 1985 Bears championship team a few months ago, he told them he was planning to get married again in April and seemed optimistic about his future. His youngest son, Brock, gave one of several eulogies on Saturday, along with Wilson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \"My dad, Dave Duerson, was a kind and generous man who believed in helping others,\" Brock said. \"Who would ever think that a small-town boy from Muncie, Indiana, would become such a success in sports, academics and business? I'm extremely proud to be a Duerson.\" Wilson remembered Duerson as a guy who would \"give the shirt off his back.\" \"He's always thinking, always working,\" Wilson said. \"That's the thing. That's why we can't play because we ain't thinking about golf. That's just the type of person he was.\" And Jackson, a friend, said, \"At the end of the day, you're measured by the box score.... When you look at the box, Dave was a winner.\" Right to the end, his friends and relatives said. The way they see it, the fact that he made sure his brain would be donated for research shows who he really was. It will be tested by the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine with the focus on chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease tied to depression, dementia and suicide. The condition has been found in numerous athletes. \"It's a wakeup call for a lot of people, when you think of concussions,\" said Emery Moorehead, a tight end on the'85 Bears team. \"Dave played a long time -- played in college, played in high school -- and this could happen at any point in time. NFL safety, they really need to address this as well as in hockey and probably boxing, which has no regulations on these types of things. CTE is very different, and we're not aware of it.\" Brock Duerson said the family will start a charity -- the Dave Duerson Foundation -- to help athletes deal with mental illness. He said the family won't get the results of the brain tests for three to six months. Duerson starred at Notre Dame before getting drafted by the Bears in the third round in 1983. Two years later, with Todd Bell sitting out the season in a contract dispute, he became a starter on one of the greatest defenses ever assembled. With Hall of Famers Mike Singletary, Dan Hampton and Richard Dent, the Bears left a trail of battered opponents on the way to the championship. Duerson did his part in the backfield with five interceptions and made the first of four straight Pro Bowls. A year later, he picked off a career-high six passes while setting what was an NFL record for sacks by a defensive back with seven. That mark stood until 2005. Duerson would go on to win another Super Bowl with the 1990 Giants after being released by the Bears, and spent three years with Cardinals before retiring after 11 seasons. He remained active in the union and served as a trustee on the NFL Players Association's retirement board. He clashed with Ditka over the way former players' claims were distributed, but the coach has said they eventually made up. Duerson was also involved in several businesses after his career. He owned a few McDonald's franchises and later helped to grow a company that supplied fast-food restaurants. He left to start his own company in 2002, and graduated from Harvard Business School's Owner/President/Management Program in 2001. But his life had taken some hard turns the past few years. His food-supply company was forced into receivership in 2006, and Duerson filed for divorce from his wife Alicia a year later. He lost his Bears-area home to foreclosure and his position as Notre Dame trustee after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge. His brother Mike Duerson, 52, said after the memorial that he's donating his brain to the same Boston clinic. He said he's had health problems since playing college basketball his freshman year at IUPUI. He said he got a concussion after taking a charge and was paralyzed on his left side for six months. \"I've been diagnosed with just about everything -- they call it alphabet soup, as far as psychological problems,\" Mike Duerson said. He said he hopes something positive comes out of his brother's death. \"I don't know if it's a wake-up call for the NFL,\" he said, \"but it may be for colleges.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6161611", "Entities": ["Bears", "Giants", "Mike Singletary", "Cardinals"]}, {"title": "Rams scout arrested during combine", "author": null, "date": "Feb 27, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Rams scout Luke Driscoll has been accused of public intoxication and public indecency after urinating on an Colts building.

But after his news conference, Reese spoke with Ronnie Barnes, vice president of medical services, who confirmed that the team had received Mathias Kiwanuka's clearance. Mathias Kiwanuka is the Giants' most versatile defensive player and was thriving in coordinator Perry Fewell's system. He had four sacks in his first three games of the season, even playing some linebacker for Fewell, until he was sidelined with the neck ailment that eventually ended his season.

According to the source, an NFL assistant coach questioned Cam Newton about why he disobeyed his coach's orders in the BCS National Championship Game. Cam Newton ran a quarterback sneak toward the end of the game rather than take a knee as he was instructed. Cam Newton was not expecting the NFL to ask him about the incident and did not have a favorable reaction, according to league sources. He got defensive, sources said. Asked about the interviews, Cam Newton said, \"Each and every team keeps you on your toes.\" Before taking a single question during his long-awaited appearance before the media at the NFL scouting combine, Cam Newton attempted to put out a different fire. In a prepared statement, the former Auburn quarterback tried to clarify a recent comment in which he described himself as \"not only as a football player, but an entertainer and icon.\" Cam Newton noticed the wave of negative reaction and felt he was misunderstood. The Heisman Trophy winner spent his first minute at the podium on Saturday explaining where his focus will be in the future, and later said that he was at fault for being unclear. \"First and foremost, I understand that my obligation is to be the best possible football player I can be,\" he said. \"I know and believe that.\" His comment drew such a reaction because some say his swagger teeters on the edge of pure arrogance. In roughly 12 minutes at the podium, he referred to himself in the third person three times. When asked if some mistake his confidence for cockiness, he said: \"I'm not sure, but I'm a confident person, and it was instilled in myself at an early age to believe in myself.\" Controversy, it seems, follows Cam Newton. Cam has said his relationship with his father is good, months after a controversy involving Cecil called Cam's eligibility at Auburn into question. The NCAA ruled in December that Cam was unaware of the pay-for-play scheme created by Cecil and the owner of a scouting service. Cecil Cam Newton and Kenny Rogers -- a former Mississippi State player who worked for an agent -- sought money for the quarterback to play for the Bulldogs. Cam Newton said Saturday at the NFL scouting combine that the scrutiny helped he and his father become closer.

It was an occurrence so out of the norm, in fact, that one reporter couldn't help but ask UConn running back Jordan Todman about his background playing football at Dartmouth (Mass.) High School. \"I feel like Massachusetts might be better than people think,\" Todman responded on a busy Saturday highlighted by Auburn quarterback Cam Newton's meet-the-press session. \"Being recruited probably wasn't as easy as if I went to a Florida school or a Texas school, but I made the best of it. I'm still here with all the players here from all over the country, so it really doesn't matter.\" While at Dartmouth High School, Todman became the second-leading rusher in state history, with 5,083 yards and 70 touchdowns. He was a two-time all-state selection and conference player of the year as a senior. \"I was recruited by Boston College and Penn State. Purdue was actually my first scholarship offer,\" Todman said. \"I went back and forth with my family. I ended up at UConn and had a great career.\" Last season as a junior, Todman rushed 334 times for 1,695 yards and was named the Big East Conference Offensive Player of the Year. In January, Todman declared as an early entrant for April's NFL draft. \"Being the second-leading rusher in the nation... I thought that it was a pretty good accomplishment,\" said Todman, who turned 21 on Thursday. \"I carried the ball a lot last year -- over 300 times -- and [so] I wanted to make my decision and chase my dream.\" Even though he has local ties, Todman said he trained for the combine across the country at Velocity Sports Performance in Orange County, Calif. He was joined there by Redskins quarterback Jake Locker and Arkansas quarterback Ryan Mallett, both of whom are expected to be selected in the early rounds of the draft. \"I'm out there with a good group of athletes, and we all push each other to do better,\" Todman said. Former UConn running back Donald Brown, a first-round selection of the Colts in the 2009 draft, also helped Todman prepare for the combine. \"I talked to [him] earlier this week and asked him for advice,\" Todman said. \"He encouraged me to go out there and do what I do, and pretty much tear it up and leave it on the field.\" One concern of teams examining Todman this week will be his small frame. While at UConn, he was listed as 5-foot-9 and 195 pounds. \"We weighed in yesterday, and I was 203 [pounds]. Just now, I went on the bench [press] and did 25 reps [of 225 pounds],\" Todman said. \"So I feel like I can withstand the pounding. Being able to carry the ball over 300 times last year can speak for my small frame. \"Not too many running backs in the NFL right now singularly carry the ball 300 times a season. For those who say I'm too small, hopefully that speaks [for that].\" Considered a mid-round prospect, Todman will join a small group of NFL players with Bay State ties -- a group including Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, Patriots defensive lineman Ron Brace, Giants linebacker Jonathan Goff and Chargers defensive lineman Jacques Cesaire, among others. \"Growing up in Massachusetts I went to a lot of Gillette Stadium games and was fortunate to play there,\" Todman said. \"You think about being the hometown-hero-type thing and going back to play in Patriots, but at this point, wherever you get drafted will become by favorite team.\" Whoever drafts Todman in April will get a self-described \" Jamaal Charles -type of back.\" The Chiefs runner was a Pro Bowl selection last season, so it is a lofty comparison.

Most thought the Colts would try to wrap up a deal for the only four-time MVP in league history before the CBA expires at the end of Thursday. And if the lockout begins, as expected Friday, things will become increasingly more complicated. Players, agents and team officials are already debating whether franchise and transition tags will carry the same weight they would in a normal league year. Teams are proceeding as if they will. Two weeks ago, the Colts designated Peyton Manning their exclusive franchise player, a move designed to keep him off the free-agent market. If the tag sticks, as team officials contend, Peyton Manning could not negotiate with other teams. He also would make $23 million if he plays under the tag next season. Indy has gone down this path before. In 2004, the Colts also gave Peyton Manning the exclusive franchise tag then signed him to a seven-year, $98 million deal and rescinded the tag. But it may not play out the same way this time. \"The players association and the management council have different interpretations about whether you can franchise any player,\" Condon said. \"We really don't know what it means, and the players don't recognize the tag.\" If there is a lockout, free agents cannot sign with other teams, players and team officials cannot communicate and teams can't even negotiate with agents to keep their own players, such as Peyton Manning. Still, Condon and Polian are not establishing a deadline. \"Certainly it would be nice to have it done by then,\" Condon said, referring to the expiration of the CBA. \"But I don't think there's any real urgency.\" Running back Joseph Addai, the Colts' top runner last season and Peyton Manning's best blitz blocker, also could become a free agent once there is a new CBA. \"Nothing yet, but he'd like to come back to Indy,\" said Ben Dogra, who represents Joseph Addai and works with Condon. \"We'll explore everything, but this is all in limbo because of the lockout, so I don't know what's going to happen.\" Owner Jim Irsay also would like to keep Adam Vinatieri, the best clutch kicker in league history. He has said the Colts contacted Adam Vinatieri's agent, Gary Uberstine, but Uberstine did not respond to an e-mail from The Associated Press on Sunday. The presumption is Peyton Manning's deal needs to be completed first. But the Colts are willing to wait to make the smart move. \"We're presuming it's business as usual,\" Polian said Wednesday. \"If that changes, we have a plan.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6164719", "Entities": ["Colts", "Peyton Manning", "Joseph Addai", "Adam Vinatieri"]}, {"title": "Mark Herzlich at ease at combine", "author": "Mike Reiss", "date": "Feb 27, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich put an early charge into the media center at the NFL combine on Sunday morning. When it was announced that Herzlich had arrived for interviews, many scurried to Podium C to chronicle his inspirational story. Wearing a combine-issued black sweatshirt with the letters \"LB\" (his position) and the number \"6\" on it, Herzlich revisited his comeback. \"My story is pretty public. I had issues. I had cancer,\" he told reporters from around the country. \"It wasn't a bad decision or anything along those lines. It's something that made me a better person. I'm happy to talk about it.\" Herzlich, who measured 6-foot-4 and 244 pounds at the combine, exhibited presence and poise during the 15-minute session in the 9 o'clock hour, speaking at the same interview podium where highly-touted Auburn quarterback Cam Newton did the day before. Herzlich arrived in town Friday, went through the standard medical testing that all prospects go through at the combine, and is now preparing for the physical tests. He was clearly comfortable in his surroundings. \"A lot of people stress about medical stuff,\" he said when asked about being poked and prodded in physical exams by 32 teams Saturday. \"I've been plenty versed on true medical stuff.\" Herzlich reiterated that he's back \"100 percent\", pointing out that he now lifts the same number of 225-pound bench-press repetitions he did before the cancer diagnosis. He was asked to assess how far back he's come as a football player. \"I think I'm back too,\" he responded. \"I've progressed, and I think everyone saw my progression week to week during the season. A lot of people don't understand, I haven't had an offseason yet to get my strength back, my speed back. My first practice was three days before my first game. This month that I've had off, the gains I've made have been incredible so far.\" Herzlich has been envisioning his progression continuing, setting him up to be at his best the next time he steps on the field, as an NFL player. He believes his versatility is an asset, as he can line up at various spots in either a 3-4 or 4-3 scheme. As for where he's seeking improvement, Herzlich pointed out that BC didn't play much man coverage. That was an area that he worked on at the Senior Bowl in January with Bengals linebackers coach Jeff FitzGerald. After the Senior Bowl, ESPN's Scouts Inc. rated Herzlich as a late fifth-round selection. Herzlich said he hasn't paid attention to such projections, although he believes he's positioned himself well to show NFL teams what he can do at the combine. \"Monday, when we work out, is going to be a fun day for me,\" he said, adding that he hopes teams see how well he runs in drills. \"My goal is to go out there and impress some people with the physical stuff.\" That focus on looking ahead, and targeting the next goal, is something Herzlich said he learned from his battle against cancer. Herzlich was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a form of cancer that can attack bones, following the 2008 season. \"Once I got diagnosed, I said a prayer every morning and night to be cancer-free and play football again,\" he said. \"That goal was what got me here. I've talked to a lot of people going through cancer right now, or are battling through something, and the biggest problem they have is not having that light at the end of the tunnel. My goal happened to be running out of the tunnel with my team. It got me through a lot of things.\" En route to the combine, Herzlich was reading a book written by motivational speaker Bob Moawad, which he said had a strong connection to his own journey. \"He talks about a guy who was always happy, always positive, and someone asked him,'Why are you always happy?' His answer was that everything in life is a choice -- you can choose to be happy or choose to be upset about it,\" he said. \"If you choose to be happy all the time, and you choose to be positive, then you're going to live a good life and succeed a lot. The power of positive thinking helps. \"My motto through it was'Stay up.' There are a lot of things that can get you down, and staying positive, keeping your head up, always looking forward, that's what I did.\" Mike Reiss covers the Patriots for ESPNBoston.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/news/story?id=6164685", "Entities": ["Cam Newton", "Bengals", "Patriots"]}, {"title": "Gerald McCoy rehabbing biceps hard", "author": null, "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "content": "NORMAN, Okla. -- Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said Sunday he's approaching his rehabilitation for a torn left biceps aggressively and he's not worried about a possible lockout of NFL players. Gerald McCoy, the third pick in last year's draft out of Oklahoma, spoke before the Sooners' women's basketball game against Baylor. Gerald McCoy suffered the injury on Dec. 12 and missed the Buccaneers' final four games after being placed on injured reserve. He said he was medically cleared on Jan. 24 and flew the next day to Chargers, where he's working with trainer Todd Durkin. Durkin previously worked with Drew Brees during the Saints quarterback's recovery from a serious right shoulder injury, and Gerald McCoy said Durkin has put together some challenging workouts. \"You guys know me,\" Gerald McCoy said. \"I'm a workhorse. I don't know how to take a break.\" One thing Gerald McCoy isn't too worried about is the looming lockout. The NFL Players Association and league owners are trying to work out a new collective bargaining agreement before the old expires at the end of Thursday. The two sides spent seven straight days negotiating in front of federal mediator George Cohen in Redskins before talks ended Thursday. They are scheduled to resume Tuesday. \"I'm working out and trying to be at my best, so when they say,'Gerald, it's time to get back to work,' I'm ready,\" Gerald McCoy said. \"I don't pay attention [to the negotiations]. I pay attention to the workouts I have to go to. I'm waiting for a phone call. When they say they've figured it out, that's when I'll show up.\" He finished his rookie season with 43 tackles and three sacks, helping Buccaneers go 10-6. The Buccaneers missed out on a playoff bid due to a tiebreaker. \"Nobody expected us to get 10 wins except us,\" Gerald McCoy said. \"We knew what type of talent we had in the locker room and the staff that we had.... It was great to see things develop, turn into what it turned into.\" He expressed pride that the NFL's offensive and defensive rookies of the year -- Rams quarterback Sam Bradford and Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh -- both played for Big 12 schools. Sam Bradford was Gerald McCoy's teammate at Oklahoma while Ndamukong Suh played college ball for Nebraska. Gerald McCoy made an impact with Buccaneers but noted his absence from various awards lists. \"When I'm training, I know what I didn't do last year and what I wanted to do,\" he said. \"I know ultimately what my goals are.... I know that it could have been me [on those lists] and it can be me.\" Gerald McCoy, from Oklahoma City, remains a fan favorite in his home state. When he was introduced at halftime, he received a loud ovation from fans. \"We have the greatest fans in the country right here in Norman,\" he said, addressing the crowd. \"You guys have played a huge role in my success. I owe a big part to all you guys back home.... I love this school. I love this community. I love the fans. I love all you guys. I love Oklahoma.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6165197", "Entities": ["Buccaneers", "Gerald McCoy", "Chargers", "Drew Brees", "Saints", "Redskins", "Rams", "Sam Bradford", "Lions", "Ndamukong Suh"]}, {"title": "Agent: Sidney Rice to be free agent", "author": null, "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "content": "Vikings wide receiver Sidney Rice will be a free agent.

He believes NFL owners and players are making progress on a new collective bargaining agreement and that next year's Super Bowl will still be played at Lucas Oil Stadium. \"I like the fact they got the mediator in there, and they're meeting seriously,\" Ballard said during this weekend's annual scouting combine. \"I'm sure they're closer than they have been in the past. They're kind of keeping it to themselves right now because they don't want to have any extra pressure on them right now.\" NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and league officials have not provided updates on negotiations before federal mediator George Cohen. The two sides met for seven consecutive days in Redskins before stopping Thursday. Talks are to resume Tuesday, less than 72 hours before the labor deal expires and a lockout could begin. On Thursday, Cohen said the two sides had made \"some progress\" but \"very strong differences remain.\" Later that day, league officials updated the head coaches and general managers and provided a list of possible scenarios. On Friday, Smith spent nearly two hours meeting with agents, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and league counsel Jeff Pash met with the owners' labor committee at the Colts' complex. Ballard, like most everyone else, has no inside information. But he surely has a rooting interest. Some estimates say losing the Super Bowl could cost Indy as much as $200 million. And after years of preparation for the city's first Super Bowl, the last thing Ballard or the host committee wants is a repeat of the 1994 baseball season. \"I can't believe they didn't do a World Series,\" he said. \"We don't want to go down that road. This model works. Everybody makes money in the NFL. So there's no reason not to continue.\" Not everyone agrees, which is why labor talks have overshadowed one of the biggest and busiest weeks of the entire offseason. The most recent CBA was signed in 2006, but owners exercised a clause in 2008 that let them opt out. League owners want a greater percentage of the roughly $9 billion in annual revenue that is shared with the players. Among the other significant issues are a rookie wage scale; the owners' push to expand the regular season from 16 games to 18 while reducing the preseason by two games; and benefits for retired players. Most expect a lockout to begin Friday, though the NFLPA could decertify before then -- a move that could prevent a work stoppage and give players more leverage in negotiations. Two agents told The Associated Press this week they believed it was a foregone conclusion decertification would happen. \"They've made it clear that football will be played at some point this season and we have to be ready to go when we do play,\" Colts linebacker Gary Brackett said Thursday. The city does have contingency plans. When the host committee made its bid, the league asked it to book two weekends for next February's game. That would give NFL officials more flexibility to move the game if there was a work stoppage. And if the league actually canceled the Super Bowl, which has never happened, the host committee said it has been assured it would be put back in line for another one. But Gary Brackett hopes that won't be necessary. \"I think both sides are working hard, and I think mediation has helped,\" he said. \"You know, I was one of those guys who wrote a 10-page term paper the night before it was due, so I'm hoping that's the case here, too.\"", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=6164530", "Entities": ["Colts", "Redskins", "Gary Brackett"]}, {"title": "Experience can resonate with players", "author": "Todd Archer", "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A little more than a minute into the January introduction of his new head coach of the Cowboys, owner and general manager Jerry Jones made reference to Jason Garrett's NFL playing career. \"He's the second man to take the job of head coach of the Cowboys that has played in the NFL,\" Jones said then. \"He's the first man to take on this responsibility that has played for the Cowboys.\" Little did Jones know then, but he was part of a trend this offseason of teams turning to former players as head coaches. Of the eight openings this offseason, five were filled by former players, including Jason Garrett, Vikings's Leslie Frazier, 49ers's Jim Harbaugh, Panthers's Ron Rivera and Titans's Mike Munchak. There are nine former players currently running NFL teams, adding Texans's Gary Kubiak, Jaguars's Jack Del Jack Del Rio, Cardinals's Ken Whisenhunt and Saints' Sean Payton, who was a replacement player for Bears in 1987. Tom Landry had a seven-year playing career, intercepting 32 passes and earning a Pro Bowl spot in 1954. By 1960, he was the Cowboys' first head coach, a position he would own until 1989. \"I think all of our playing experiences resonate regardless of what level you played at,\" Jason Garrett said. Yet NFL playing experience gives head coaches an advantage over those without it, although it does not guarantee success. Players will give those who have done what they are doing the benefit of the doubt. At least to a point. \"But if I can't teach a guy offensive line play after two weeks, that may go out the window real fast,\" Mike Munchak said. \"Initially I think players react better to someone who has been in their shoes, but that's only going to last so long.\" Mike Munchak is the most accomplished of the players turned coaches, building a Hall of Fame career in 12 years in Texans. Leslie Frazier was a starting cornerback and Ron Rivera was a backup linebacker when Bears won a Super Bowl in 1985. Del Jack Del Rio went to one Pro Bowl in his 11-year career. Ken Whisenhunt played for three teams in eight years, mostly as a blocking tight end. Like Jason Garrett, Jim Harbaugh, Gary Kubiak and Sean Payton were quarterbacks. Jim Harbaugh started 144 games at quarterback for Bears, Colts, Ravens and Chargers and nearly directed the Colts to a Super Bowl appearance against the Cowboys in 1995. Gary Kubiak was a backup quarterback like Jason Garrett, starting five games in his nine years as John Elway's number 2. Sean Payton played three games for Bears, completing 8-of-23 passes with no touchdowns and one interception. \"Playing experience is not the critical factor,\" Jim Harbaugh said. \"It's the ability to teach and communicate and have a plan and have the convictions to stick with the plan and have a feel for what the changes are.\" The Cowboys have six assistant coaches with NFL playing experience of varying degrees: tight ends coach/passing game coordinator John Jason Garrett (two years), running backs coach Skip Peete (one year), secondary coach Brett Maxie (nine years), quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson (19 years), assistant head coach Jimmy Robinson (six years) and kicking coach Chris Boniol (six years). Super Bowl champion Packers had nine assistant coaches with NFL experience, most in the NFL. \"Just to be a player in the National Football League, the sacrifices they have to make, the innate ability to survive and overcome, the work ethic, there are so many components those individuals have coming into your organization,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said leading up to Super Bowl XLV. \"It's something you can help develop and mentor and help them be a good assistant coach.\" After he was named interim coach last season, Jason Garrett said he had to guard against being sympathetic to the players' feelings because he had walked in their shoes not too long ago and knew the grind of the preparation. For most of his eight weeks as head coach, Jason Garrett had the players in shoulder pads for Wednesday practices. Some players credited the 5-3 finish to the season to the more physical practices. Others grumbled privately. Jason Garrett stuck to his convictions. \"I think players want structure,\" Jason Garrett said. \"I think players want discipline. I think players want to be coached hard. In the end, that's going to allow them to be the best player they can be. Sometimes, they don't necessarily like the coach right now. The goal is for them to like and love you later, and I think there are a lot of stories about that in our league through the years where if you went day to day and asked certain players about a particular coach at a particular time during the experience, maybe their comment would be different than it would be 10 years after they were done playing. \"So what we try to do is provide structure and discipline and hopefully coach them in a way that makes them better.\" Todd Archer covers the Cowboys for ESPNCowboys.com.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/columns/story?columnist=archer_todd&id=6164375", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Jason Garrett", "Vikings", "Leslie Frazier", "49ers", "Jim Harbaugh", "Panthers", "Ron Rivera", "Titans", "Mike Munchak", "Texans", "Gary Kubiak", "Jaguars", "Jack Del Rio", "Cardinals", "Ken Whisenhunt", "Saints", "Sean Payton", "Bears", "Colts", "Ravens", "Chargers", "Packers", "Mike McCarthy"]}, {"title": "Source: Bears tender Danieal Manning", "author": null, "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "content": "Bears safety Danieal Manning rejected an extension offer during the season worth $6 million over three years, with $2 million guaranteed, according to NFL sources, but last week the team extended him an original-compensation tender. Danieal Manning finds himself in an interesting situation. Without a salary cap and CBA, Danieal Manning is technically a restricted free agent, which means that if another team signed him to an offer sheet and Bears failed to match it, the team signing the safety would owe the Bears a second-round pick. The problem, though, is Danieal Manning will likely be able to command more on the free-agent market -- which won't open up until there's a new collective bargaining agreement in place -- if he turns out to be an unrestricted free agent. The prevailing thought from NFL officials at the combine was that a new CBA would likely change the qualifications for unrestricted status from the current six accrued seasons to just four accrued seasons, which is why players such as Danieal Manning -- who has five accrued seasons -- aren't sure of their free-agent statuses. Keeping with the NFL's \"business as usual\" approach in the days leading up to the expiration of the current CBA, the Bears, according to multiple NFL sources, have tendered several players, in addition to Danieal Manning, in the last few weeks. The list of free agents with fewer than six accrued seasons the Bears are believed to be focusing on include: quarterback Caleb Hanie, linebacker Nick Roach, and cornerback Corey Graham. Bears general manager Jerry Angelo did not return calls seeking comment, but said on Friday the club would start making roster moves this week. \"We talked about everything, talked through the issues, and then whatever decisions we will make with our present roster, we will make next week,\" Angelo said. \"If there's anything with players or a player, we will cement that all next week.\" Danieal Manning, who was a second-round selection of the Bears in 2006, is a member of the largest restricted free-agent class in league history. Having turned down the extension offer -- which was nearly identical to the deal signed by defensive tackle Matt Toeaina in December -- during the season, Danieal Manning is now in line to receive $1.29 million in 2011 if he signs the team's tender, which is highly unlikely. The current league year expires at 11 p.m. CST on March 3, and the owners are expected to lock out the players if the sides can't come to an agreement on a new CBA by that deadline. Interestingly, once a new CBA is in place, the tenders around the league may ultimately mean nothing, several agents at the NFL combine said. There's so much ambiguity about players' free-agent statuses because of the current labor strife, that owners are \"basically covering their bases,\" one NFL source said. \"It's just good business on their part for them to do that.\" To qualify for unrestricted free agency, a player has to accrue six NFL seasons, which wasn't the case in the past with a CBA in place. When the league operated under a CBA, players needed just four accrued seasons to become unrestricted free agents. But those rules changed in 2010, the last season of the old agreement, and the qualifications for unrestricted free agency went to six seasons. Linebacker Brian Iwuh also finds himself in the same position. The Bears are believed to be working to sign Iwuh to a multiyear extension. A five-year veteran, Iwuh finished the 2010 season with 16 tackles, a sack and two forced fumbles and tied for second on the team with 18 special-teams stops. Michael C.

The collective bargaining agreement says the NFLPA in effect must wait six months to decertify if it does it after the collective bargaining agreement expires. It expires at 11:59 p.m. Thursday night. If the union decertifies, it is no longer a union, and the National Labor Relations Board loses its hold over the NFLPA. The owners are expected to claim the decertification is a sham and challenge it in the NLRB. But the NFLPA is poised to act this week before it is locked out. It already has obtained unanimous approval from players across the league to decertify, a process it undertook throughout last season and the union's executive committee reaffirmed that vote this past Tuesday to empower NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith to take this action. The primary reason for decertification would be to file for an injunction that, if granted, would prevent the owners from locking out the players. NFLPA officials and players believe that this could be the only hope to have a full NFL season next year. Furthermore, decertifying as a union prior to the expiration of the CBA would allow NFL players to seek injunctive relief and commence anti-trust action against owners in front of U.S. District Court Judge David Doty, who has had jurisdiction over the current labor agreement since 1993. Owners have attempted unsuccessfully to have Doty removed from jurisdiction and strategically want the CBA to expire to effectively eliminate his authority, a source said. The NFL and NFLPA are scheduled to meet with federal mediator George Cohen one more time on Tuesday, yet after seven days of meetings last week, Cohen said significant differences still remain. Commissioner Roger Goodell met Friday morning with the majority of the league's ownership labor committee at the offices of the Colts, a league official has confirmed, briefing the 10-man group on labor negotiations. Nine of the 10 members of the owners' labor committee were in attendance on Friday: co-chairman Jerry Richardson of the Panthers; Mike Brown of the Bengals; Clark Hunt of the Chiefs; Jerry Jones of the Cowboys; Robert Kraft of the Patriots; Mark Murphy of the Packers; John Mara of the Giants; Art Rooney II of the Steelers; and Dean Spanos of the Chargers. Co-chairman Pat Bowlen of the Broncos was absent but an official believed he participated via phone conference.

Like last year, this is considered a defensive-line dominated draft, but Cam Newton showed enough potential to be considered at number 1. If Cam Newton does well in his interviews with the top teams in the draft, he could be the story on draft day in New York. Here is what we learned Sunday: 1. Cam Newton is the real deal: Cam Newton doesn't use much of his legs when he throws the football, but his arm is so naturally strong he can throw 50 to 60 yards with ease. There are no throws he can't make. He reminds me a lot of a young Steve McNair. Cam Newton is 6-foot-5, 248 pounds and ran an official time of 4.59 seconds in his 40-yard dash Sunday. The team that drafts him can probably expect a completion percentage of 54 in his first year and plenty of big plays. He doesn't do well throwing to his left, but a lot of young quarterbacks have that problem in their first couple of pro years. Ben Roethlisberger, who compares to Cam Newton a lot, had that problem in his first couple of years. Cam Newton was 1-for-3 on short out passes and missed all three of his passes on deep throws down the left sideline. He also missed three short out passes to his right. But Cam Newton can rifle accurate turn-in passes and his post-corner routes are exceptional. If you are Panthers and Bills, he's the type of quarterback you can build around as long as you have good coaching and patience. His arm is stronger and more natural than Steve Young's. 2. Mallett wins first major passing competition: Arkansas quarterback Ryan Mallett put on an impressive show with the first group of quarterbacks, edging out University of Redskins quarterback Jake Locker, who bounced back nicely from a subpar Senior Bowl. Mallett's strong arm was on display Sunday. On deep seam routes, he was flawless. His fastball delivery on out passes was impressive. Though he struggled with turn-in passes to his left, he was perfect on four throws to his right on post corners and showed great touch on his deep passes. Jake Locker had two unofficial 40 times of 4.52, which would have made him the fourth-fastest quarterback in the combine since 1999. Officially, he was given a 4.59, but everyone knew he could run. The best part of Sunday for Jake Locker was how consistently he was throwing the ball. He didn't make back-to-back bad throws in any of the drills, which was a plus. He was natural on slant routes and 12-yard curls were impressive. His ease in throwing post-corner routes showed first-round potential. Missouri's Blaine Gabbert elected not to throw, but he ran a 4.62 40. Nevada's Colin Kaepernick looked good on short and intermediate throws, but he had one of the worst days of all the quarterbacks on long passes because of bad footwork. Florida State's Christian Ponder was a little more impressive than TCU's Andy Dalton. 3. A.J. Green vs. Julio Jones: Coming into the combine, it seemed to be a foregone conclusion A.J. Green of Georgia was the number 1 receiver. However, the best receiver on the field during Sunday's drills was Julio Jones of Alabama. Julio Jones had unofficial 40 times of 4.43 and 4.39 and he seemed to explode into his routes faster than A.J. Green, who had unofficial 40 times of 4.48 and 4.51. Unfortunately, Pitt wide receiver Jonathan Baldwin didn't have the great combine everyone expected. He ran a 4.52 40 and fell down during one of the receiving drills. What became clear Sunday was it's a two-receiver race at the top between A.J. Green and Julio Jones. If Julio Jones doesn't go ahead of A.J. Green, he won't slip too many spots. He's 6-2\u00be, weighs 220 pounds and can run in the high 4.3s. That's a raw talent. 4. RB class lacks speed: The 2011 class of running backs doesn't run very fast. Alabama's Mark Ingram trimmed down to 215 pounds but had unofficial 40 times of 4.58 and 4.61. Illinois' Mikel Leshoure, one of the top three backs in the draft, did a little better at 4.56. But most of the top backs didn't run very fast. Virginia Tech's Ryan Williams had times of 4.55 and 4.59. Oklahoma State's Kendall Hunter maintained his second-round rating with a 4.47. Oklahoma's DeMarco Murray helped his stock with a 4.45. But there isn't much explosiveness among this group of runners. Ingram still has a good chance of going to Dolphins in the middle of the first round, but overall, the running back crop is far from scintillating. 5. Patrick Peterson's lofty pursuits: Since 1999, 14 cornerbacks who ran 4.39 or better in the combine have been selected in the first round. However, none went higher than number 5. Patrick Peterson of LSU plans to change that. Patrick Peterson confirmed he was clocked at 4.2 at LSU last spring. The last 40 he ran was a 4.29. He hopes to run before the conclusion of the combine. Here's the difference: None of those 14 cornerbacks has Patrick Peterson's body. Patrick Peterson is 6-foot, 219 pounds and hopes to emulate the game of Charles Woodson. \"I don't want to be the next Charles Woodson, but I pattern myself after Charles Woodson,\" he said. DeAngelo Hall is the only one of the 14 first-round cornerbacks who ran at the combine with 4.39 speed or better and weighed more than 200 pounds. He was 202 pounds at the 2004 scouting combine and ran a 4.34 40. Terence Newman of the Cowboys ran a 4.37 in 2003 combine and was the fifth pick in that draft. Champ Bailey posted a 4.28 and was the seventh pick in 1999. What Patrick Peterson does this week and in April might be historic.

The Cowboys have interviewed several defensive ends and safeties at the Senior Bowl and national scouting combine as possible replacements. Spears, who was drafted 20th overall in the 2005 draft, proved to be a productive player for the Cowboys yet was replaced in the starting lineup by Stephen Bowen after suffering a left calf strain. Spears, who has eight sacks and 16 tackles for loss in his career, was placed on injured reserve Nov. 10. Spears was irked before the start of the 2010 season, when the team tendered him at original draft pick level ($1.226 million) for the 2010 season. That offer was lower than backups Jason Hatcher and Stephen Bowen received via second-round tender deals. Spears said during the season he wants to return, but he's seeking a long-term contract and was willing to test free agency. Gerald Sensabaugh signed with the Cowboys in 2009 after spending four seasons with the Jaguars. He started 14 games in 2009 and had only one interception but 10 pass breakups. In 2010, Gerald Sensabaugh tied for the team lead with five interceptions, but the secondary struggled as the Cowboys allowed 57 plays of 20 or more yards. The Cowboys want to lower these numbers and believe a better pass rush and improved play overall at the safety and cornerback positions can help. The Cowboys may go the free-agent route to address needs at the safety spot. Danieal Manning, O.J. Atogwe and Abram Elam could be possible fits. Danieal Manning is expected to be a restricted free agent. If that's the case, the Cowboys would have to offer some compensation to the Bears. But Danieal Manning, a native of from Corsicana, Texas, has a desire to play for the Cowboys. Abram Elam played for the Cowboys in 2006. New Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan coached Abram Elam last season in Browns.

U.S. District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn ruled Monday that the NFL should provide a \"limited\" time extension for displaced fans to consider their options and receive additional information. The ruling came after a hearing in a class action lawsuit stemming from the seating fiasco at Cowboys Stadium. Temporary seats were deemed unsafe on game day, requiring 400 fans to stand throughout the stadium. Plaintiffs' attorney Michael Avenatti said the fans now have 60 days to evaluate their choices.

The word waterfalls cascading through this cyberspace are the absurd products of Ben and Skin, and only Ben and Skin. The ideas expressed in this \"column\" in no way represent the thoughts of anyone else even remotely related to ESPN Cowboys. In fact, ESPN Cowboys has no idea what to make of any of this. So uhh, oh yeah, you can hear the aural version of this insanity every weekday from 9 a.m. to noon on 103.3 FM ESPN. Here come the Internet, sucka: Ben: There's no way Jerry's triple-fake interest in Cam Newton is anything but completely, extremely, very fake, very much. He's got his QB, and a really good one at that. Romobowl will get it done and get it done real good as soon as Jerry quits taking stupid pills when it comes to outfitting his offensive hogs. I'd love to see how good Romo could be with even a shred of non-strike-year-like blocking. Anyone thinking the Cowboys should draft Cam Newton (assuming he's even available when they pick at nine) is either stupid or dumb/stupid. Romo has at least six more years of magic to gunsling. Skin: This reminds me so much of when news started leaking last year that Jerry was wining and dining Dez Bryant. Something wacky is going on here. It's the old end-around -- because Jerry wants everyone to forget that his glorious moment in the Super Bowl sun turned out to be just like Leon Lett's Thanksgving Day ice disaster. Besides, Cam is a big dude. Pretty sure he could replace Marc Colombo till Romo is done. Although he could end up on the Heat sooner than later since by all accounts he wants to be baby Bron Bron. Ben: Thanks for ruining my football buzz by bringing up the player that torments me most when I put on my Crazy Ray pajamas and close my eyes at night. Dez, Dez, Dez. He could be Michael Irvin or he could be Antonio Dez Bryant. He could make it into the Ring of Honor or he could make everyone miss Pacman Jones for his wisdom. He's on a gravy train with biscuit wheels but I don't know if he has what it takes upstairs to keep it on the plate. Skin: The Dez pick was vintage Jerry shoot from the hip. He thought they were good at every position so he decided to gamble on wild talent and potential wrapped up in a cocoon of red flags. Well they didn't have the talent he thought they had and now Wilford Brimley is coming home to roost. If Dez treats his football career like his scheduled appearances then the Cowboys will be standing around staring at their watches while their NFC rivals collect jewelry. Skin: I know a lot of folks are trippin' that the Mavs didn't make a move, but they didn't need to. This team is fine. They're 40-7 with Dirk and Tyson in the lineup together. It's party time, Italian style. They haven't even scratched the surface of the awesomeness this crew can achieve. You'll know what I mean when Peja Stojakovic's beard reaches Christian Bale status. Call me, I'll be waiting in the hot tub. Ben: I just hope you don't end up swirling around the bottom of that Mavs Kool-Aid hot tub toilet and clogging it with your new Justin Bieber wig. That could be bad for both you and your expensive beaver pelt front-mullet. Look, I want to believe. I almost believe. In fact, I WILL believe. I'm already prepared to claim that I never had an ounce of doubt if they can miraculously ride the Dirk Express all the way to the finals. But this squad has had many glorious regular seasons only to turn into a pumpkin as soon as the clock strikes playoffs that I simply cannot hand over my battered and beleaguered heart without serving up a heaping platter of chicken fried skepticism. Skin: Don't turn this Mavs ride into an entire album of Auto-tuned Kanye love songs. Ben, you once sat me down and told me the tragic story of how both of your brothers turned their backs on the Texas Rangers after years of torment and disappointment. They distanced, thought they were too good for it. So what happened? The Rangers go to the World Series and your brothers weren't allowed to come along for the most glorious ride ever. Why? Because they were hung up on a dreary past that doesn't represent the dreams and hopes of the Ranger children of today and tomorrow. So now they're forced to be Stars fans, and who the hell wants to end up like that Ben? Who, Ben, who? Tell me Ben. Your brothers? Hah!! Well I tell you that you no longer have brothers, Ben. Just two lifeless bodies floating through life in Rangers baseball-hating Rogers body suits. And that's a tragedy I simply can't allow you to become. Ben: OK, you're finally starting to make some sense. By pointing out that my brothers have both morphed into walking zombie-style flesh-mannequins with no real attachments to professional sports, you've regained your lost credibility. Save a seat for me in case the Mavs make it to the conference finals. Something on an aisle preferably. Ben: While it saddens me deeply that Cliff Lee spurned the Rangers and left their rotation without his dominant country robotics, it hasn't prohibited me from ramping up my excitement for the coming season one bit. I'm still confident that Jon \"JD\" Daniels and his miracle working front office posse will pull a star rotation rabbit from the hat before the trade deadline. Those dudes had us all eating expensive steakhouse masterpieces last year on a rusty tuna can budget. By the way, did anyone ever determine which one of the Duke brothers Tom Hicks was? I always hated how he did Louis Winthorpe III... oh and the Rangers, too. Man, I hope Cliff Lee's wife is reading this on a smart phone while stuck in bumper-to-bumper Eagles traffic. Skin: In Philly it's all about mass transit so she leaves the chuck wagon at home. But I'm fascinated by your Claw Fever slogan... Is that official? I like the idea of continuing with the \"time\" theme. Like maybe \"Time is abstract\" and doing some sort of Stephen Hawking tie-in or \"Time, Time, Time is on my side\" and getting the Stones to play every Friday night before they set off fireworks. Just kind of thinking aloud here. Get me to Surprise and I can figure it out. Ben: \"Claw Fever, catch it.\" Naw, it kind of has a bird flu vibe. And advertising folks frown on flu-based marketing campaigns. I like \"It's time to be time again\" or \"This time, it's really time\" or \"This time, it's really time, this time.\" Or they could roll with something like \"Wait till you see what we trade for Cliff Lee this time.\" Skin: You're probably right about staying away from the sickness and death idea. I guess that eliminates my \"Rangers Baseball Will Kill You This Time\" idea. And then I guess we can also scratch \"Even Though It's Summer Fun Time, Everyone Will Eventually Die in Time\" off the list. I just hope the Cowboys' slogan next season isn't \"It's Dez Time and Nobody Has Any Idea Where The Hell He Is.\" That'll suck for everyone.

Love, who attended Carter High School and the University of Arkansas, is projected to be picked late in the first round or early in the second round of the draft. The offensive lineman can play tackle or guard, but NFL teams want him mainly at tackle. Spend some time with Love as he describes his journey to the NFL. This week's entry recounts his experience at the combine in Colts. I left for the combine Wednesday morning and was pretty excited about the process. I'd seen the entire deal on television, so I just wanted to show off my skills to teams and stuff. When I got to town, I just couldn't sleep. I was so hyped up and excited about things that by the time I did get to sleep, it was time to wake up. They woke us up around 5:30 a.m. and took us to a local hospital for physicals. They checked out my entire body, and if you had an old injury, they would make you get an MRI. I didn't have any of those, but I had to tell them everything that was wrong with me, a nagging injury, anything. I talked to about 20 NFL teams, but I had four 15-minute meetings with the Raiders, Panthers, Lions and Steelers. The questions were pretty basic, but these NFL teams do their homework. They know everything about you. You meet with scouts, coaches and all sorts of things. Teams asked me about leadership and what I would do in certain off-the-field situations. It was OK; it was pretty fun. But sometimes the questions and things can get nerve racking. I also took this Wonderlic test and it was cool. It was basic, and I thought I did pretty good. Not sure on my score, but it wasn't scary at all. When it came time for the workouts, I was excited to do the bench press. I lifted 225 pounds 28 times, but my goal was to do it 30, and when I get back to training, I want to work harder on that. I ran my 40-yard dash times about 5.29 and 5.28 seconds, and that wasn't what I wanted to do. My agility time, 4.84, has to get down, and my cones were 7.7. After seeing these drills up close, I think when I have my pro day in a few weeks it will be better. In terms of my stock, I don't think I did anything to help or hurt myself. I could have done better, but that's what I have my pro days for. I got home Saturday night, and spent time with family and friends, and just chilled out a little bit. I did finally get some sleep. I guess I was so hyped up about things that I couldn't when I was in Indy. Now I'm getting some rest before I get back to work at the Michael Johnson Performance Center in McKinney.", "link": "https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=6168549", "Entities": ["Cowboys", "Colts", "Raiders", "Panthers", "Lions", "Steelers", "Michael Johnson"]}]
