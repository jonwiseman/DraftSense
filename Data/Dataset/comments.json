And the man I had as the top prospect still sits on the board  &nbsp;  Editing for the sake of posterity because someone gilded this ironically today 1 8 20 - looking back, I still prefer Rosen as a prospect. Allen completed 56 percent of his passes as a two-season starter, and that was against Mountain West competition. Over time that has often proved a damning deficiency among quarterback draftees. Still, there are exceptions to every rule - see the careers of Drew Brees and Russell Wilson despite their lack of traditional height requirements.  I wasn't completely in love with anyone from the 2018 quarterback class, but I thought Rosen had the best profile to become a successful player worthy of a top-10 draft pick. He was easily the most proficient pocket passer with ample experience in a pro-style offense, and his game seemed to align most closely with the style of play that has dominated the quarterback position for the last 20 years in the NFL.  I've been entirely surprised to see Lamar Jackson becoming by far the most successful quarterback from the class at this point, and it'll be interesting to see how the players continue to progress. Rosen has been an utter failure but there's still plenty of time to change that. Then again, if he's the earliest player of the Mayfield Darnold Allen Rosen Jackson first round to bounce out of the league, feel free to shower me in Manningfaces.

They\u2019re the great ones \u2026 He\u2019s hard to pin down because he\u2019s so slippery with his feet. He runs 4.66, which is good-plus, not great. But he\u2019s so much quicker than he is fast. I mean, this guy is a cat. He could play in the 3-4, too.\u201d Jadeveon Clowney 6-5 \u00bd, 266, 4.52 was the first pick in 2014. Myles Garrett 6-4 \u00bd, 270, 4.64 was the first pick in \u201917. Garrett\u2019s arms were 35 \u00bc inches, Clowney\u2019s were 34 \u00bd and Chubb\u2019s were 34. \u201cLittle bit like Garrett but probably has a little more grit,\u201d a second scout said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a full game. Plays hard. Sets the edge. Has range. Physical, strong, quick, fast as a rusher. He\u2019s long. He can bend. Good contact balance. Jason Pierre-Paul 6-4 \u00bd, 266, 4.72 was probably a freakier athlete but this guy is ready to go.\u201d Finished with 204 tackles 60 for loss, 26 sacks and nine forced fumbles in 49 games 38 starts.

At this point, I believe Gettleman was secretly and collaboratively hired by the Eagles, Cowboys and Redskins to sabotage the Giants.

When I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse and Gettleman and the front office couldn\u2019t make any more terrible decisions, I...  I... Well, I was just dead wrong.   We needed a pass rusher and every reasonable Giants fan knew this.  So when Josh Allen miraculously became available at 6, I was wondering why it was taking them so long to get to the podium to announce him.    Daniel fucking Jones?!?!?!  Even the draft analysts were stunned and didn\u2019t have anything ready for analysis or maybe they did and since I was so upset screaming, I may have not heard, but I felt like they weren\u2019t ready for that and had no preparation because it was such a reach.   We could\u2019ve paired Allen a Jersey boy with Lorenzo Carter for a young, dynamic and without question, supremely athletic pass rush.    Instead, we get a guy who they so desperately want to be a Manning; just because the guy is southern and coached by Cutcliffe does not mean he\u2019s a fucking Manning.  He has an average, maybe slightly above, has below average accuracy 59% comp and a losing record in college, 17-19.  Any NFL-caliber, let alone franchise caliber QB should have more success in college with even marginal talent.  Let\u2019s face it, the Giants are a racist organization as they weren\u2019t gonna have a black QB be the face of the franchise.    I cannot trust a single thing the Giants do any longer as they have been basically the Cleveland Browns the past 7 years.  Prediction:  Eli has a mediocre year and the Giants go 5-11 again. Jones never develops into the franchise QB the 6th pick warrants and we waste the best years of a HOF career from Saquon.   TLDR: The Giants fucking suck.

In 1968, Brown was charged with assault with intent to commit murder after model Eva Bohn-Chin was found beneath the balcony of Brown's second-floor apartment.34 The charges were later dismissed after Bohn-Chin refused to cooperate with the prosecutor's office. Brown was also ordered to pay a $300 fine for striking a deputy sheriff involved in the investigation during the incident. In Brown's autobiography, he stated that that Bohn-Chin was angry and jealous over an affair he had been having with Gloria Steinem and this argument is what led to the misunderstanding with the police.35  >In 1970, Brown was found not guilty of assault and battery, the charges stemming from a road-rage incident that had occurred in 1969. In 1975, Brown was sentenced to one day in prison and two years probation, and to pay a fine of $500 for beating and choking his golfing partner Frank Snow.36 In 1985, Brown was charged with raping a 33-year-old woman.37 The charges were later dismissed.38 In 1986, Brown was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend Debra Clark. Clark refused to press charges, though, and Brown was released.39 In 1999, Brown was arrested and charged with making terrorist threats toward his wife. Later that year, he was found guilty of vandalism for smashing his wife's car with a shovel.40 He was sentenced to three years' probation, one year of domestic violence counseling, and 400 hours of community service or 40 hours on a work crew along with a $1,800 fine.41 Brown ignored the terms of his sentence, and in 2000 was sentenced to six months in jail for refusing the court-ordered counseling and community service. He was released after 3 months.424344", "label": -1}, {"subject": "Kizer", "comment": "Maybe more than once, but that ruins NFL Networks 'we take the high ground' narrative.

Footwork is very good. Ability to go through read progressions is above average. Poise in pocket is also above average. Strong arm and can make tough throws.  He has accuracy problems: mostly underthrowing receivers. He tends to wait for the receiver to get open as opposed to throw the receiver open. This waiting for the receiver to get open is why he underthrows receivers because by the time the receiver is open he's facing pressure and makes a bad throw. This can be improved with repetition and developed chemistry your WRs.  People need to keep in mind that Kizer's incredible 2015 season was one where he started out as a backup quarterback. Meaning he had 0 chemistry with first team receivers. And only 2 years before that, he was considered a very raw talent coming out of high school.   Kizer's 2016 season was one where the oline was less experienced than the prior year which had a 1st round LT and a 2nd round C and the WRs were also inexperienced and none of them had ever really started a game. Notre Dame's defense was atrocious with alot of injuries and a lack of depth due to off the field issues. On top of that, coaching was subpar. One can point to Brian Kelly calling vs. NC State where he called for 26 passing plays in a fucking monsoon as compared to NC State who called 14 passing plays. Because of all these factors, the only star of ND football was Kizer and he, righty so, felt a lot of pressure to shoulder the burden and win games for the team.  Are Brian Kelly's comments right about Kizer? Yes, he does need further development. 2 years. He's only 3 years removed from when he was considered a raw talent.

There is only one reason I am ok with the trade up to get Mahomes and that reason is Todd Blackledge. I'm sure most people on here are thinking who the fuck is Todd Blackledge. He is the last QB that the chiefs drafted in the first round.....in fucking 1983.   For years I have wanted the Chiefs to draft and develop their own QB, but instead have got other teams retreads time and time again. The Chiefs haven't had a true top tier QB as long as I can remember. Sure, we had Montana for a couple years, but that was the tail end of his career. Trent Green was good, but his success was more because of one of the best O-lines ever assembled and a fantastic running game that other teams had to plan for. Alex Smith has been a good QB, but he just isn't the guy to get you over the top.   So, I am happy with this move, even though we gave up a huge amount for it, because I'm just sick and fucking tired of never trying. Is Pat Mahomes going to be a star franchise QB, I don't know, but I'm a happier fan because we at least tried for once.

Further, those saying '49ers fucked the Bears in the ass' or whatever are just as bad. If Trubisky doesn't pan out, then spending 3 is almost as bad. If he does pan out, then whomever the Bears beat to the pick by adding an extra few points of value to the offer will be kicking themselves for over a decade.

Point of Contention 1: Credentials  Argument For: Mitchell Trubisky has been scouted as a top QB in the draft. He was projected to go top 10, so drafting him 2nd overall is not necessarily a stretch. Many pre-draft rumors had multiple teams possibly interested in him.  Arugment Against: He only played one season of college football, probably needs to take a season to learn some NFL mechanics and nuances. Could be a bust isn't this a point for every player  Point of Contention 2: The Trade  The Chicago Bears had pick 3 in the draft and traded with the 49ers for the 2nd pick. The Bears gave up their 3rd overall pick, 3rd and 4th ROUND pick, and next year's 3rd ROUND pick to draft Trubisky 2nd overall.  Argument For: The Bears think that this is their QB, and if they are right it could turn around their franchise as QBs are extremely important for winning. The argument is that the Bears gave up a lot because there was another team also bidding for the 2nd overall pick the 49ers had. This is why the price was so steep.  Argument Against: The Bears have a lot of holes. While QB is one of them, they gave up two other picks in this draft that could have helped them get some depth for other positions needed. Another argument against is that trading up was unnecessary. Some say that the Bears shouldn't have given up so much but see the argument for as to why they did. Some are saying that they could have drafted Trubisky at their original pick because the 49ers didn't want him anyway, or that they could have drafted an equally strong QB with the 3rd pick OR that their overall draft would have been better with all their other picks still in their possession", "label": -1}, {"subject": "Trubisky", "comment": "The NFL draft is a yearly event for teams to acquire new college talent to improve their team for the upcoming season and beyond.
