He was projected to go top 10, so drafting him 2nd overall is not necessarily a stretch. Many pre-draft rumors had multiple teams possibly interested in him.\n\nArugment Against: He only played one season of college football, probably needs to take a season to learn some NFL mechanics and nuances. Could be a bust (isn't this a point for every player)\n\nPoint of Contention 2: The Trade\n\nThe Chicago Bears had pick 3 in the draft and traded with the 49ers for the 2nd pick. The Bears gave up their 3rd overall pick, 3rd and 4th ROUND pick, and next year's 3rd ROUND pick to draft Trubisky 2nd overall.\n\nArgument For: The Bears think that this is their QB, and if they are right it could turn around their franchise as QBs are extremely important for winning. The argument is that the Bears gave up a lot because there was another team also bidding for the 2nd overall pick the 49ers had. This is why the price was so steep.\n\nArgument Against: The Bears have a lot of holes. While QB is one of them, they gave up two other picks in this draft that could have helped them get some depth for other positions needed. Another argument against is that trading up was unnecessary. Some say that the Bears shouldn't have given up so much (but see the argument for as to why they did). Some are saying that they could have drafted Trubisky at their original pick because the 49ers didn't want him anyway, or that they could have drafted an equally strong QB with the 3rd pick OR that their overall draft would have been better with all their other picks still in their possession"}, {"comment_id": "dgupjxi", "post_id": "67zpod", "comment": "The NFL draft is a yearly event for teams to acquire new college talent to improve their team for the upcoming season and beyond.\n\nThe Bears traded the 3rd overall pick, along with 2 other picks later in the draft, and their ~~1st Round (1-32 pick based on record)~~ 3rd round pick next year to move up to the 2nd overall pick which is crazy, then they spent the pick on a player who a lot of people consider isn't worth drafting this high.\n\nThey essentially \"wasted\" their most important draft pick this year along with 2 other later round picks, and ~~next years most important draft pick~~ next years 3rd round pick for a player who probably won't be very good.\n\nEveryone is laughing at them basically."}, {"comment_id": "dgup1z5", "post_id": "67zpod", "comment": "I'm from /r/all.
