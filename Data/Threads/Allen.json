That completion percentage against lesser competition is just such a red flag... And the man I had as the top prospect still sits on the board\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEditing for the sake of posterity because someone gilded this ironically today (1/8/20) - looking back, I still prefer Rosen *as a prospect.* Allen completed ~56 percent of his passes as a two-season starter, and that was against Mountain West competition. Over time that has often proved a damning deficiency among quarterback draftees. Still, there are exceptions to every rule - see the careers of Drew Brees and Russell Wilson despite their lack of traditional height requirements.\n\nI wasn't completely in love with anyone from the 2018 quarterback class, but I thought Rosen had the best profile to become a successful player worthy of a top-10 draft pick. He was easily the most proficient pocket passer with ample experience in a pro-style offense, and his game seemed to align most closely with the style of play that has dominated the quarterback position for the last 20 years in the NFL.\n\nI've been entirely surprised to see Lamar Jackson becoming by far the most successful quarterback from the class at this point, and it'll be interesting to see how the players continue to progress. Rosen has been an utter failure but there's still plenty of time to change that. Then again, if he's the earliest player of the Mayfield/Darnold/Allen/Rosen/Jackson first round to bounce out of the league, feel free to shower me in Manningfaces.

They\u2019re the great ones \u2026 He\u2019s hard to pin down because he\u2019s so slippery with his feet. He runs 4.66, which is good-plus, not great. But he\u2019s so much quicker than he is fast. I mean, this guy is a cat. He could play in the 3-4, too.\u201d Jadeveon Clowney (6-5 \u00bd, 266, 4.52) was the first pick in 2014. Myles Garrett (6-4 \u00bd, 270, 4.64) was the first pick in \u201917. Garrett\u2019s arms were 35 \u00bc inches, Clowney\u2019s were 34 \u00bd and Chubb\u2019s were 34. \u201cLittle bit like Garrett but probably has a little more grit,\u201d a second scout said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a full game. Plays hard. Sets the edge. Has range. Physical, strong, quick, fast as a rusher. He\u2019s long. He can bend. Good contact balance. (Jason) Pierre-Paul (6-4 \u00bd, 266, 4.72) was probably a freakier athlete but this guy is ready to go.\u201d Finished with 204 tackles (60 for loss), 26 sacks and nine forced fumbles in 49 games (38 starts). Scored 19 on the 50-question Wonderlic intelligence test. \u201cHe\u2019s got a little stiffness but he\u2019s OK,\u201d said a third scout. \u201cHe\u2019s a 4-3 right end.
