In 1968, Brown was charged with assault with intent to commit murder after model Eva Bohn-Chin was found beneath the balcony of Brown's second-floor apartment.[34] The charges were later dismissed after Bohn-Chin refused to cooperate with the prosecutor's office. Brown was also ordered to pay a $300 fine for striking a deputy sheriff involved in the investigation during the incident. In Brown's autobiography, he stated that that Bohn-Chin was angry and jealous over an affair he had been having with Gloria Steinem and this argument is what led to the \"misunderstanding with the police.\"[35]\n\n>In 1970, Brown was found not guilty of assault and battery, the charges stemming from a road-rage incident that had occurred in 1969. In 1975, Brown was sentenced to one day in prison and two years probation, and to pay a fine of $500 for beating and choking his golfing partner Frank Snow.[36] In 1985, Brown was charged with raping a 33-year-old woman.[37] The charges were later dismissed.[38] In 1986, Brown was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend Debra Clark. Clark refused to press charges, though, and Brown was released.[39] In 1999, Brown was arrested and charged with making terrorist threats toward his wife. Later that year, he was found guilty of vandalism for smashing his wife's car with a shovel.[40] He was sentenced to three years' probation, one year of domestic violence counseling, and 400 hours of community service or 40 hours on a work crew along with a $1,800 fine.[41] Brown ignored the terms of his sentence, and in 2000 was sentenced to six months in jail for refusing the court-ordered counseling and community service. He was released after 3 months.[42][43][44]"}, {"comment_id": "dgw3dnn", "post_id": "686lgj", "comment": "Maybe more than once, but that ruins NFL Networks 'we take the high ground' narrative.

Footwork is very good. Ability to go through read progressions is above average. Poise in pocket is also above average. Strong arm and can make tough throws.\n\nHe has accuracy problems: mostly underthrowing receivers. He tends to wait for the receiver to get open as opposed to throw the receiver open. This waiting for the receiver to get open is why he underthrows receivers because by the time the receiver is open he's facing pressure and makes a bad throw. This can be improved with repetition and developed chemistry your WRs.\n\nPeople need to keep in mind that Kizer's incredible 2015 season was one where he started out as a backup quarterback. Meaning he had 0 chemistry with first team receivers. And only 2 years before that, he was considered a very raw talent coming out of high school. \n\nKizer's 2016 season was one where the oline was less experienced than the prior year which had a 1st round LT and a 2nd round C and the WRs were also inexperienced and none of them had ever really started a game. Notre Dame's defense was atrocious with alot of injuries and a lack of depth due to off the field issues. On top of that, coaching was subpar. One can point to Brian Kelly calling vs. NC State where he called for 26 passing plays in a fucking monsoon as compared to NC State who called 14 passing plays. Because of all these factors, the only star of ND football was Kizer and he, righty so, felt a lot of pressure to shoulder the burden and win games for the team.\n\nAre Brian Kelly's comments right about Kizer? Yes, he does need further development. 2 years. He's only 3 years removed from when he was considered a raw talent. But when putting the 2 years in context, Kizer has done remarkably a lot. He's got the highest ceiling of any quarterback in this draft.\n\nI just hope the Browns don't ruin him.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dgw4kk1", "post_id": "686lgj", "comment": "Watched every snap of his in college.
