At this point, I believe Gettleman was secretly and collaboratively hired by the Eagles, Cowboys and Redskins to sabotage the Giants.  He\u2019s gotten rid of 5 of our 6 best players (OBJ, Collins, Vernon, Snacks, JPP) in less than a year.  He passes on a QB last year to waste the immense talents of Saquon...\n\nWhen I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse and Gettleman and the front office couldn\u2019t make any more terrible decisions, I...  I... Well, I was just dead wrong. \n\nWe needed a pass rusher and every reasonable Giants fan knew this.  So when Josh Allen miraculously became available at 6, I was wondering why it was taking them so long to get to the podium to announce him.  \n\nDaniel fucking Jones?!?!?!  Even the draft analysts were stunned and didn\u2019t have anything ready for analysis (or maybe they did and since I was so upset screaming, I may have not heard), but I felt like they weren\u2019t ready for that and had no preparation because it was such a reach. \n\nWe could\u2019ve paired Allen (a Jersey boy) with Lorenzo Carter for a young, dynamic and without question, supremely athletic pass rush.  \n\nInstead, we get a guy who they so desperately want to be a Manning; just because the guy is southern and coached by Cutcliffe does not mean he\u2019s a fucking Manning.  He has an average, maybe slightly above, has below average accuracy (59% comp) and a losing record in college, 17-19.  Any NFL-caliber, let alone franchise caliber QB should have more success in college with even marginal talent.  Let\u2019s face it, the Giants are a racist organization as they weren\u2019t gonna have a black QB be the face of the franchise.  \n\nI cannot trust a single thing the Giants do any longer as they have been basically the Cleveland Browns the past 7 years.  Prediction:  Eli has a mediocre year and the Giants go 5-11 again. Jones never develops into the franchise QB the 6th pick warrants and we waste the best years of a HOF career from Saquon. \n\nTLDR: The Giants fucking suck.  \n\n*Seriously though, Giants fan or not, you should read everything as I believe I made some good points."}, {"comment_id": "eltpffi", "post_id": "bhgcck", "comment": "Imagine if this is one of those threads we come back to in 5 years and laugh at how wrong it is."}, {"comment_id": "elu0n6n", "post_id": "bhgcck", "comment": "Preparing to tank for next season"}, {"comment_id": "elve43x", "post_id": "bhgcck", "comment": "You got Gettleman.
