There is only one reason I am ok with the trade up to get Mahomes and that reason is Todd Blackledge. I'm sure most people on here are thinking who the fuck is Todd Blackledge. He is the last QB that the chiefs drafted in the first round.....in fucking 1983. \n\nFor years I have wanted the Chiefs to draft and develop their own QB, but instead have got other teams retreads time and time again. The Chiefs haven't had a true top tier QB as long as I can remember. Sure, we had Montana for a couple years, but that was the tail end of his career. Trent Green was good, but his success was more because of one of the best O-lines ever assembled and a fantastic running game that other teams had to plan for. Alex Smith has been a good QB, but he just isn't the guy to get you over the top. \n\nSo, I am happy with this move, even though we gave up a huge amount for it, because I'm just sick and fucking tired of never trying. Is Pat Mahomes going to be a star franchise QB, I don't know, but I'm a happier fan because we at least tried for once. \n"}, {"comment_id": "dguphky", "post_id": "6800lh", "comment": "Mad we now have two QB's that are better than yours?"}, {"comment_id": "dgul2a0", "post_id": "6800lh", "comment": "Broncos will be worse than the chiefs next year"}, {"comment_id": "dgul4vl", "post_id": "6800lh", "comment": "r/the_darnold"}, {"comment_id": "dguox40", "post_id": "6800lh", "comment": "I'm thinking it'll be trade ammo for a promising QB or if there's a sure thing at another position. \n\nAssuming we miss the playoffs (as is tradition) we can offer a mid 1st and what will likely be a mid-high first for a top 5 pick, or possibly #1 or #2 with some added bullshit picks.

That means it will cost a lot more to trade up and teams that need a QB are going to be less likely to want to trade the pick away.  This trade would not be enough to move up to get a QB next in all likelihood. "}, {"comment_id": "dguu3ec", "post_id": "6800lh", "comment": "How can anyone justify this pick at all. Mahomes is a great quarterback, but this is a very big waste. Not only are you overvaluing the pick purely based off of overall draft order, but you are giving up to much to get the pick. Lets say that their is a need for a new QB, then wait till next draft and pick up a new QB. However, I would say their is no need at all at QB, but a much larger need at WR or OL. There where great WR available at 10 and you can easily trade for OL. Additionally, I think it could be justified to simply wait till pick 24 and pick up someone like Dalvin Cook, a great RB prospect that can give you a different look from the 2 current RB. This s probably the worst way I see using these picks especially considering you are giving up next years 1st round which is a better draft class.
